Our Cash Account, which currently has an APY that\u2019s 5x the national average per FDIC.gov, is just one way we do that. Over the last 15 months, we\u2019ve paid out over $113 million of interest to Cash Account clients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier this spring, we came up with an idea to do more than just pay a competitive interest rate. We decided to <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wealthfront-is-giving-away-100k\/\">give away a total of $100,000<\/a> in the Wealthfront Cash Giveaway, where the winners would receive&nbsp; $25,000 each. We were incredibly excited to give the money away because we love rewarding our clients and we hoped that the cash would have a large, positive impact on the winners\u2019 financial lives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We were gratified to learn that this was exactly what happened. When the Cash Giveaway ended, we reached out to the Wealthfront clients who won to hear what winning $25,000 meant to them. We discovered that the prize meant a lot to our winners \u2013 whether it enabled them to achieve a large financial goal or gave them extra financial security in a challenging time. We\u2019re very happy for the winners, and we loved hearing their stories. Read on to meet three of the winners of Wealthfront\u2019s Cash Giveaway.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Anthony<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"516\" height=\"530\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Anthony-Hanna-4-516x530.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13126\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Anthony-Hanna-4-516x530.jpg 516w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Anthony-Hanna-4-487x500.jpg 487w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Anthony-Hanna-4-768x789.jpg 768w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Anthony-Hanna-4-1495x1536.jpg 1495w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Anthony-Hanna-4-1993x2048.jpg 1993w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 516px) 100vw, 516px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Anthony says that winning $25,000 in the Cash Giveaway is \u201clife changing.\u201d This Wealthfront client has been working towards a big goal: saving to send his six-year-old Isaac to college one day. He says it\u2019s \u201chuge and significant\u201d for him to have his son\u2019s tuition taken care of. Isaac isn\u2019t yet sure what he wants to be when he grows up, but has plenty of time to decide. Anthony hopes that Isaac decides to go to Arizona State University just like he did.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anthony works for a bank, and is a fan of the Cash Account for its competitive APY. \u201cThe rates have always been really high and nice,\u201d he says. He also likes that he can see a consolidated picture of his finances in the Wealthfront app.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Anshul<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"528\" height=\"530\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/anshul-528x530.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13124\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/anshul-528x530.jpg 528w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/anshul-498x500.jpg 498w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/anshul-768x771.jpg 768w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/anshul.jpg 963w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 528px) 100vw, 528px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Anshul was very surprised when he heard the news that he\u2019d won $25,000 in Wealthfront\u2019s Cash Giveaway. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt so lucky,\u201d he says. He\u2019s a software developer who enjoys hiking in his spare time. He\u2019s also a newlywed. He and his wife Nivetha got married in India in January \u2013 and both of them are Wealthfront clients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anshul says he plans to invest his winnings for the long term so he and Nivetha can save for a home \u2013 potentially in the Bay Area. When Anshul told his friends he\u2019d won $25,000, they were incredulous at first. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Jeff<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSpeechless\u201d is how Jeff described himself after learning he\u2019d won $25,000. This Wealthfront client is a physical therapist at an outpatient facility and was furloughed because of the impact of COVID-19. He says the money couldn\u2019t have come at a better time for him.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jeff recently had to cancel a trip to Europe where he and his girlfriend planned to visit exchange students they previously hosted \u2013 one in Berlin and one in Prague. He hopes to reschedule one day soon. In the meantime, he plans to save his $25,000 or put it toward his remaining student loans.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ryan<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"486\" height=\"530\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Winner-3_-Ryan-486x530.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13145\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Winner-3_-Ryan-486x530.jpg 486w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Winner-3_-Ryan-459x500.jpg 459w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Winner-3_-Ryan-768x837.jpg 768w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Winner-3_-Ryan-1409x1536.jpg 1409w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Winner-3_-Ryan.jpg 1573w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Ryan is a regular reader of the Wealthfront blog and vaguely remembers reading about the Wealthfront Cash Giveaway earlier this spring. But when he found out he won, he still says he was \u201cin shock.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ryan lives in Houston, Texas where he was also born and raised. He describes himself as \u201ca pretty big saver\u201d and says that he likes using the Wealthfront Cash Account because it offers a much higher APY than big banks do \u2013 meaning his cash actually grows. He likes checking the app to watch his balance increase from month to month. Ryan is being careful with his winnings in this economic environment, and says he\u2019ll likely save it for the future. If he spends it, he says it\u2019ll be to pay off his student loans.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Getting you more<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re thrilled for the Wealthfront clients who won our $100,000 Cash Giveaway.
