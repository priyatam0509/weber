He writes about the famous supermarket experiment in which two tasting displays, one with six jams and one with 24, were set up in a store. More people stopped at the 24-jam table, but far more people who stopped at the six-jam table actually bought jam. The point is supported by research into investor behavior, as well, as we wrote about in this post, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/blog\/stupid-investors-library-congress\/\">The Nine Stupid Things Investors Do, According to the Library of Congress<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>1990, redux: There will be a compromise<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Washington, D.C., continues to stumble painfully toward a budget compromise this week, in a season of party infighting that\u2019s likely to make and break political careers.

The ratings agencies said that they would downgrade the United States\u2019 sterling credit rating if the parties couldn\u2019t reach a budget compromise, or if the budget compromise wasn\u2019t fiscally responsible enough. \u00a0Since the compromise will happen, the only real question was how thoroughly the agencies were going to examine it. S&amp;P\u2019s president <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/business\/economy\/sandp-softens-stance-on-debt-rating-debate\/2011\/07\/27\/gIQArAKmdI_story.html?hpid=z1\">said midweek<\/a> that even plans that reduced the deficit less than the previously mentioned $4 trillion could still preserve the rating.<\/p>\n<p>Earlier this week <em>The Economist<\/em> made the point that the worst possible scenario for the ratings agencies would be for them to downgrade the debt \u2013 and find that nobody cared. The agencies will act cautiously.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Silver lining<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The debt negotiations may spur investors to diversify their assets, as the Aleph Blog suggests in this posting, <a href=\"http:\/\/alephblog.com\/2011\/07\/27\/where-to-hide\/\">Where to Hide<\/a>. Here\u2019s our take on what a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/blog\/jim-cramers-mad-money-diversification-idea-astray\/\">diversified portfolio<\/a> should look like.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Soros leaves the party<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The news that iconic investor George Soros\u2019s advisory firm would no longer manage money that\u2019s not his own drew readers\u2019 interest this week, rising to the tops of most-read lists on web sites. Soros made billions as an investor and then became a philanthropist and advocate (lately supporting legalized marijuana in California). Soros Fund Management aims to avoid new disclosure regulations placed on hedge fund managers who invest outsiders\u2019 money, according to a statement from his company. So the firm is returning the outside money and transitioning to a family office.<\/p>\n<p>A <em>Bloomberg BusinessWeek<\/em> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/2011-07-26\/soros-to-end-four-decades-as-hedge-fund-leader-by-returning-investor-cash.html\">article<\/a> offered one other possible explanation \u2013 that Mr. Soros wanted to leave the party while he was still having a good time. Referring to Soros\u2019s flagship Quantum Endowment Fund, the story reported:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhile Quantum has returned about 20 percent a year, on average, since 1969, when its predecessor was started, according to a person familiar with the firm, the fund\u2019s performance has suffered in the last 18 months. In the first half of this year, Quantum lost about 6 percent, the person said, following a gain of 2.5 percent in 2010. Other macro funds have returned 5.6 percent in the last year-and-a-half, according to Chicago-based Hedge Fund Research Inc.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>A new window into Google<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Google, whose business practices are under anti-trust review by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, this week said it would stop using rivals\u2019 reviews in its own Google Places service, which this <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/intl\/cms\/s\/2\/561dcd98-b61f-11e0-8bed-00144feabdc0.html?segid=20006&amp;ftcamp=product\/contextual\/rss\/outbrain\/companies\/auddev#axzz1T8Eq5SHH\">Financial Times story<\/a> said marked the first time the Internet giant had reversed course under growing criticism about unfair business practices.<\/p>\n<p>Not exactly directly investment-related, but related, because Google controls so much of the information flow you use to make decisions. People used to say that <em>The New York Times<\/em> set the agenda in the United States. These days, Google search does.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What not to believe<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This week, the idea pervading the web is that a government default is possible. This is one of those cases where any journalist worth her salt knows the possibility of a default is extremely, extremely low \u2026 but in this age where the \u201cextreme story\u201d sells, people are writing as if default were a high probability.<\/p>\n<p>Predictably, after weeks of reading media reports explaining the various ways in which a default might happen, investors started to get a little skittish that one will happen. Funny how that works: the media drives up ratings by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/2011-07-28\/u-s-credit-swap-trading-surges-80-as-debt-ceiling-deadline-gets-closer.html\">being alarmist<\/a>, and individual investors are <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2011\/07\/28\/business\/economy\/investors-worried-about-debt-talks-look-for-havens.html?_r=1&amp;hp\">alarmed<\/a>, as a <em>New York Times<\/em> story reports about how few havens there are for investors.<\/p>\n<p><em>The opinions expressed by guest bloggers and\/or blog interviewees are strictly their own and do not necessarily represent those of Wealthfront Inc.
