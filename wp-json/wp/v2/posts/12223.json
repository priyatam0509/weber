It\u2019s another example of our ability to use software to take a process that can be complex and require lots of paperwork and make it as easy as clicking one button for no additional cost. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How our clients can benefit from Roth conversions<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First, a little background: When you have a traditional or SEP IRA, you may earn a tax deduction for your contributions and pay taxes on distributions in retirement. With a Roth IRA, you pay taxes on contributions and then enjoy tax-free growth and distributions in retirement as long as you meet the qualifying conditions. There are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/retirement-plans\/amount-of-roth-ira-contributions-that-you-can-make-for-2019\">income limits<\/a> that prevent many clients from contributing directly to a Roth IRA: for 2019, they are $137,000 for an individual and $203,000 for a married couple filing jointly. Roth conversions allow you to take advantage of the tax benefits associated with a Roth IRA even if you earn too much to meet the income requirements. In general, there are two common reasons people consider it:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. If you expect your income for the year to be unusually low, perhaps because you\u2019re going back to school or taking some time off to travel. In this situation, you can convert an existing traditional IRA or SEP IRA (maybe one that you rolled over from a previous employer\u2019s retirement plan) into a Roth IRA, pay taxes now while you\u2019re in a lower tax bracket, and then receive tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. If you contribute to your employer\u2019s 401(k) plan, but you want to save even more each year for retirement in a tax-advantaged account. With a Roth conversion, you can make a nondeductible contribution to a traditional IRA and then convert those funds to a Roth IRA which will then grow tax-free.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interested in learning more about Roth conversions? <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/should-you-consider-a-roth-ira-conversion\/\">Check out this blog post<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>So how does it work? <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We designed this experience to be effortless and automated. Typically, the Roth conversion process requires lots of paperwork. With Wealthfront, Roth conversions are simple to execute on our mobile app or web site. If you already have a Wealthfront Roth IRA, navigate to the Wealthfront Traditional IRA account dashboard and click \u201cConvert funds to a Roth IRA.\u201d If you don\u2019t have a Roth IRA, just click \u201cOpen new account,\u201d select Roth IRA, and then choose the Wealthfront Traditional IRA as the funding source. From there, we\u2019ll automatically convert the funds to your Wealthfront Roth IRA. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.wealthfront.com\/public.email.images\/roth_conversion_v3.gif\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>During tax season, we\u2019ll automatically issue Forms 1099-R and 5498, and remind you of an additional tax form that you may need to file directly. It doesn\u2019t get any easier than that.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>One piece of the puzzle<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You already know we believe in investing in a diversified portfolio of low-cost index funds. We also think it\u2019s important to focus on minimizing fees and minimizing the taxes you pay.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Wealthfront, we\u2019re committed to helping our clients get the most out of their money and we\u2019re always looking for ways to deliver more value by applying software to problems that technology is better at solving than people are.
