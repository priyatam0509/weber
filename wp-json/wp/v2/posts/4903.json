And while we work to make our service better every day, it feels only right this time of year to take a moment to just say thank you. 2014 has been a momentous year for Wealthfront, and we know our success stems directly from the trust and support our clients place in us.<\/p>\n<p>When we launched Wealthfront just three years ago in December 2011, no one would have guessed how quickly our service would grow. After starting the year at an <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wealthfront-half-billion-500-million-aum\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">unprecedented $500M<\/a> in client assets, we were humbled to have our thought leadership recognized by the industry when we were named <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wealthfront-etf-strategist-of-the-year\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ETF Strategist of the Year<\/a>. In March we announced a new vision for the future of investing, called the <strong><em><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/automated-investment-service-institutional-financing-round\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">automated investment service<\/a><\/em><\/strong>, along with $35 million in fresh capital to fund that effort.<\/p>\n<p>Charles Schwab built its business by focusing on the needs of the baby boomer investor. It grew with the boomers to create one of the most important investment firms over the past 40 years. Today, Schwab manages over $2.4 trillion. It took Schwab six years to reach its first $1 billion in client assets. <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/one-billion-assets-under-management\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">It took Wealthfront less than 2.5 years<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/hh-allteam-2014-blog.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-4906\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/hh-allteam-2014-blog.jpg\" alt=\"hh-allteam-2014-blog\" width=\"570\" height=\"335\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>At Wealthfront, we&#8217;re excited about <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wealthfront-announces-financing-7-trillion\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the once-in-a-generation opportunity<\/a> to build a different type of service that is helping the millennial generation invest the right way. To finance this vision, and to ensure we had the capital to remain independent, Wealthfront announced we raised <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wealthfront-announces-financing-7-trillion\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">an additional $64.2 million<\/a> in October, bringing our cash reserves to over $100 million.<\/p>\n<p>Wealthfront now manages over $1.7 Billion in client assets, a leap of more than $1.2 Billion in 2014 alone. For context, this means that in three short years Wealthfront has become larger than <a href=\"#TOPRIAS\">99.7%*<\/a> of all registered investment advisors in the United States.<\/p>\n<h2>Everyone Deserves Sophisticated Financial Advice<\/h2>\n<p>We&#8217;re proud of our track record of leadership through innovation, and 2014 was no exception. <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wealthfront-iphone-app\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wealthfront for iPhone<\/a> launched in the beginning of the year, bringing with it an experience designed from the ground up for mobile, including the innovative newsfeed interface for tracking activity on your account. A number of improvements continued to roll out through the year, including our early support for <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wealthfront-bigger-better-touch-id\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Touch ID<\/a> security.<\/p>\n<p>In April, Wealthfront launched Selling Plan for Twitter and Facebook, providing clients with significant positions in those companies access to free, automated daily stock sales, helping manage their transition to a more diversified portfolio.<\/p>\n<p>In August, we announced <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wealthfront-workplace\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wealthfront for the Workplace<\/a>, which we are piloting with <strong>Google<\/strong>, <strong>Palantir<\/strong> and <strong>The San Francisco 49ers<\/strong>. These companies share our desire to innovate and help the millennial generation invest.<\/p>\n<p>In October, we celebrated <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/tax-loss-harvesting-improvements-intelligent-recovery-predictive-deposits\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the two-year anniversary<\/a> of our tax-loss harvesting service, announcing both <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/tax-loss-harvesting-improvements-intelligent-recovery-predictive-deposits\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">enhancements to the service<\/a> and ground-breaking <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/new-research-efficacy-tax-loss-harvesting\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">new research<\/a> on the results of daily tax-loss harvesting on your long term investments over time periods as long as 30 years.<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, to close out 2014, we launched the next generation of index investing with the <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/introducing-direct-indexing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wealthfront Stock-level Tax-Loss Harvesting Platform<\/a>. Building on the tremendous popularity of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/tax-optimized-direct-indexing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the Wealthfront 500<\/a>, we&#8217;re excited about the potential for our new platform to bring the benefits of Stock-level Tax-Loss Harvesting to a much broader base of Wealthfront clients.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, we deliver all these new capabilities at an exceptionally low cost &#8211; a flat rate of 0.25% of assets under management and no commissions. We do this because we truly believe that <em>everyone deserves sophisticated financial advice<\/em>.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_4904\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/WealthfrontMottoChalkBoard.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4904\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4904\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/WealthfrontMottoChalkBoard.png\" alt=\"WealthfrontMottoChalkBoard\" width=\"600\" height=\"258\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/WealthfrontMottoChalkBoard.png 1011w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/WealthfrontMottoChalkBoard-640x275.png 640w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/WealthfrontMottoChalkBoard-768x330.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-4904\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Wealthfront manifesto, written on the wall of our headquarters in Palo Alto.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>A Big 2014, and a Bigger Future<\/h2>\n<p>We believe we&#8217;re building something new.
