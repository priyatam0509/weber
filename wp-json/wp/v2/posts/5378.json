The evidence is overwhelming that those who check their portfolios on a daily basis tend to underperform those who\u00a0check their portfolios less frequently.<\/p>\n<p>The reason is simple: On any given day, there\u2019s almost a 50-50 chance the market will be up or down. Because people dislike losses more than than they enjoy gains \u2013 a behavioral finding known as <em>loss aversion <\/em>\u2013 people who check their portfolios daily find the process painful. And just like your gut reaction to pain is to draw away from the source of that pain, your gut reaction to seeing an investment lose money is to make a change. To sell. To panic. To act.<\/p>\n<p>Changing your portfolio, or market timing as our Chief Investment Officer Dr. Burton Malkiel calls it, is an investor\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/top-investor-mistake-time-market\/\">Most Serious Mistake<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>So what\u2019s the solution? Just check your portfolio less often, right?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Unfortunately, things really don\u2019t get much better if you check less frequently.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We looked at historical market data going back as far as possible (1871, to be precise) to ask what the probability is that the market is down depending on how often you check.<\/p>\n<p>Over the last 144 years, there was a 39% probability that an investor who checked her portfolio once a month would see the market down. Even if she\u00a0looked once a year, there\u2019s still a 31% chance that the market will be in the red.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/probability_graph.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5379\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/probability_graph.png\" alt=\"probability_graph\" width=\"570\" height=\"343\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Credit goes to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2015\/08\/25\/upshot\/how-emotion-hurts-stock-returns.html?ribbon-ad-idx=8&amp;rref=business\/dealbook&amp;module=Ribbon&amp;version=context&amp;region=Header&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=DealBook&amp;pgtype=article&amp;abt=0002&amp;abg=1&amp;_r=1\">Justin Wolfers<\/a> for inspiring this chart.

Even if you control your curiosity and only check on your investments once a year, you\u2019re going to spend a third of your life fuming at the results!<\/p>\n<p><strong>It isn\u2019t your fault: The human body simply isn\u2019t built for making good investment decisions <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Loss aversion isn\u2019t driven by mental weakness; it\u2019s a biological phenomenon. A study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences showed that loss aversion is primarily driven by the amygdalae, two almond-shaped parts of the brain that are key components our limbic system, which is responsible for most of our emotional life. The study found that people with damaged amygdalae aren\u2019t loss averse.<\/p>\n<p>Does that make you want to get rid of your amygdalae?<\/p>\n<p>Scholars of evolutionary psychology actually believe that loss aversion is one of the reasons we are here today. Recent research suggests loss aversion became an important part of human nature tens of thousands of years ago, when we were foragers (McDermott, Fowler, and Smirnov, 2008). Running out of food was fatal, so if our ancestors ended up in a location where there wasn\u2019t enough food they had to react quickly and change plans. Those who weren\u2019t loss averse didn\u2019t survive.<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s important to realize is that a loss in your investment portfolio isn\u2019t the same as running out of food. Running out of food is an immediate problem; a temporary loss in your investment portfolio isn\u2019t.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, it\u2019s a problem that tends to even itself out over time. As the chart below shows, <em>$1 invested in 1871 is worth nearly $34,000<\/em> <em>today<\/em>. It just took some bumps along the way.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/value_log.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5380\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/value_log.png\" alt=\"value_log\" width=\"570\" height=\"388\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>At Wealthfront we try to make very clear that our investment approach is only appropriate for the long term.
