Here we\u2019ll explain three major ways traditional banks do that and what it means for you as a consumer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>They don\u2019t pay you interest on your deposits<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest way banks make money is by minimizing the interest they pay you on your deposits. In banking jargon, this is known as maximizing their \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/n\/netinterestmargin.asp\">net interest margin<\/a>\u201d \u2013 but it\u2019s just a fancy way of saying they\u2019re making money on your money and not passing it along to you.&nbsp; When you deposit money at your bank, it doesn\u2019t just sit there. Your bank loans it out and earns interest on those loans. Ideally, your bank would then share that interest with you. In reality, they seldom do. Banks have a strong incentive to pay you as little as possible because banks with the lowest cost of funds (read: those that pay the least interest) tend to have the highest relative valuations (meaning they\u2019re seen as more profitable). In short, they maximize the interest they earn while minimizing what they pay you on your own deposits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s look at what this means for you. Say you have a checking account that earns no interest (which is fairly common). You deposit $10,000 into that account and your bank then loans out your cash. If your bank earns 2.8% loaning your money out for mortgages but pays you 0% APY, they\u2019re earning a 2.8% net interest margin on your cash that\u2019s equivalent to $280 over the course of a year \u2013 and you\u2019re earning nothing. They could raise your APY, but then they\u2019d make less money.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some banks (like First Republic Bank, for example) attempt to confuse the issue by offering what they call a \u201cpreferred interest rate\u201d on loans like mortgages to lure you into maintaining a large account balance with them. But don\u2019t be fooled: these so-called \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/five-irrational-fears-keep-people-firing-advisor\/\">preferred rates\u201d rarely make economic sense<\/a>. You\u2019re paying for this lower rate by keeping your money in an account that earns little or no interest. To make matters worse, your rate isn\u2019t actually \u201cpreferred.\u201d If you shop around, you can find a better one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>They charge you unnecessary fees<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of minimum balances, most banks will charge you a fee if you fall below a particular account balance. Worse still, you can trigger this fee if you fall below the threshold even once \u2013 even if your average account balance far exceeds the minimum and even when you hold a balance way above the threshold in another account at the same bank. This is just one example of the <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/what-you-should-know-about-bank-fees\/\">many account fees<\/a> banks charge to make money off of their customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another example of a trigger-based fee that generates a significant amount of revenue is the overdraft fee. Your bank will charge you a significant fee (often $30 or more) if you overdraft your account. What\u2019s worse is that your bank will do this even when they know you have a pending direct deposit that will settle in a day or two.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Banks also make money on the fees associated with currency exchange and wire transfers. In general, you\u2019ll pay a premium to exchange currency at most retail banks compared to what you\u2019d pay elsewhere. When you send a wire transfer, you typically have to visit a bank branch because the limits to send a wire transfer without visiting a branch can be frustratingly low. You\u2019ll also pay your bank a fee as high as $35. What\u2019s even more egregious is that many banks charge you to <em>receive<\/em> a wire even in cases when they didn\u2019t do the work of setting it up.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>They slow down your money movement<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the early days of the U.S. banking system, it took days to move money around. Before ACH transfers, there was the Pony Express. Whenever you paid someone by check, it took days to clear because the check had to physically arrive at the bank where it could be accounted for. There was really no way around this, and it led to a phenomenon called \u201cfloat\u201d where slow money movement caused money to exist in two places at once.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now there\u2019s no reason it should take multiple days for a check to clear \u2013 but it still does. For the most part, it\u2019s something bank customers have gotten used to and banks have quietly profited from. When you send a check electronically, your bank often deducts the money from your account the moment you hit \u201csubmit\u201d even though they may not send the check for several more days. During that time, your bank has access to your money and can earn interest on it until the funds leave the bank, but you cannot.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another example of this is how your bank generally receives your paycheck from your employer two days before they make it available to you. During that time, they earn interest loaning out your money while you can\u2019t access your pay. Over the course of a year, that means your bank is making 48 days\u2019 worth of interest on your pay before you can even access it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Doing things differently<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At Wealthfront, our mission is to build a <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wealthfronts-new-mission\/\">financial system that favors people, not institutions<\/a>.
