In more than 30 states, you can deduct contributions from your state taxes, and no matter where you live, earnings are tax-free. Withdrawals will be, too, as long as your child uses the money for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/credits-deductions\/individuals\/qualified-ed-expenses\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">qualified higher education expenses<\/a> at any <a href=\"https:\/\/fafsa.ed.gov\/FAFSA\/app\/schoolSearch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">eligible institution<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>529 plans are also popular because they don\u2019t have contribution limits. The only \u201climit\u201d is that, if you contribute more than $15,000 in a year, you\u2019ll have to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/forms-pubs\/about-form-709-united-states-gift-and-generation-skipping-transfer-tax-return\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">report it as a gift on your taxes<\/a>. It will then count toward your lifetime gift tax exclusion limit (which you don\u2019t have to worry about unless you plan to give away more than <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/ashleaebeling\/2017\/10\/19\/irs-announces-2018-estate-and-gift-tax-limits-11-2-million-per-couple\/#3396b5224a4b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$5.6 million<\/a> in your lifetime).<\/p>\n<p>There is, however, an exception to the $15,000 rule <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2014<\/span> and it could serve as a powerful tool in preparing for your child\u2019s college expenses.<\/p>\n<h2>It\u2019s a bird, it\u2019s a plane\u2026 it\u2019s superfunding<\/h2>\n<p>Unlike retirement savings, which have decades to compound and grow, you\u2019ve usually only got around 18 years before you\u2019ll need to pay for Junior\u2019s education.<\/p>\n<p>To help compensate for this, the IRS offers a workaround: You can fund a 529 with up to five years of contributions at once \u2014 up to $75,000 per parent, for a total of $150,000 \u2014 without it counting toward your lifetime gift tax exclusion limit. This feature, called superfunding, dramatically increases how much money you can use to jumpstart a 529.<\/p>\n<p>Obviously, that\u2019s a ton of money to allocate to a savings plan <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2014<\/span> but if it\u2019s financially possible for you, the benefits are pretty incredible. (That\u2019s why we designed the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/college\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wealthfront 529<\/a> with superfunding as a standard option.)<\/p>\n<h2>The power of superfunding<\/h2>\n<p>Why is superfunding a 529 plan so effective? When you front load your contributions, the account gets a full 18 years to compound.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s an example that illustrates the power of superfunding:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Annual saver: Every year for 18 years, William and Kate diligently contribute $7,778 to a 529 plan, for a total of $140,000.<\/li>\n<li>Superfunder: On the day their child is born, Harry and Meghan superfund a 529 with $140,000, and then go on their fabulous way, never touching the account again.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Both accounts earn the annual expected returns associated with the Wealthfront 529 College Savings Plan; for a client with a <a href=\"https:\/\/support.wealthfront.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/213257646-How-did-Wealthfront-recommend-my-529-investment-plan-and-glide-path-\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">high risk score<\/a>, that\u2019s an average of 4.7%.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9124 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/SavingforCollege_Visuals_R3-02.png\" alt=\"Saving for College: The Power of Superfunding\" width=\"1472\" height=\"1995\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Can you believe the results?

That\u2019s because it requires making one large deposit, and thereby avoiding the decision fatigue <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2014<\/span> and potential disillusionment <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2014<\/span> you might face with an 18-year saving program. (Especially important during those teenage years, when your kids are giving you attitude for days!)<\/p>\n<h2>More (super) food for thought<\/h2>\n<p>Before superfunding a 529 plan, here are a few more things you should consider:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Liquidity<\/strong>: Can you really afford to take $140,000 and lock it away in a tax-deferred account for 18 years? You\u2019ll face stiff penalties if you withdraw money for non-college expenses.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Commitment<\/strong>: How confident are you that the money will be used for your child\u2019s education? What happens if they win a full-ride scholarship or decide to take a different path? Though 529 plans allow you to switch beneficiaries to relatives like siblings or cousins, it\u2019s a question worth considering.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Plan selection<\/strong>: Some 529 plans have few fund choices and high fees. So, if you\u2019re going to superfund, make sure it\u2019s into a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/college\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">low-cost plan with high-quality investments<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Use windfalls to superfund<\/h2>\n<p>Windfalls are large, one-time financial gains; they could occur when your employer goes public, for example, or when an elderly relative leaves you an inheritance.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve received a windfall, superfunding a 529 plan might be a good way to use it. Not only will it create a healthy college fund for your child, it could bring you peace of mind as well.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s what we mean: How would it feel to know you\u2019ve made a significant contribution to your child\u2019s future education &#8212; without the need for ongoing savings and maintenance? Probably pretty good.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why, if you have the resources, superfunding a 529 is a smart strategy for reaching your college savings goals.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; line-height: 12px;\"><strong>Disclosure<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; line-height: 12px;\">For more information about the Wealthfront 529 College Savings Plan (the \u201cPlan\u201d), download the Plan Description and Participation Agreement (to be made available on Plan launch) or request one by calling or emailing support@wealthfront.com or (650) 249-4250.

You also should consult your financial, tax, or other advisor to learn more about how state-based benefits (or any limitations) would apply to your specific circumstances. You also may wish to contact directly your home state&#8217;s 529 plan(s), or any other 529 plan, to learn more about those plans&#8217; features, benefits and limitations.

Backtesting has the inherent limitations of not representing actual trading and not reflecting the impact that material economic and market factors might have had on the Wealthfront&#8217;s decision\u00admaking if Wealthfront were actually managing clients&#8217; money at that time. It also does not take into consideration the effect of changing risk profiles or future investment decisions. Several processes, assumptions and data sources were used to create one possible approximation of how a Wealthfront 529 plan might have benefited investors in the past, and a different methodology may have resulted in a different outcome. The results of this simulation should not be relied upon for predicting future performance and is not a guarantee of actual performance.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; line-height: 12px;\">The return data presented is based on an average Wealthfront high net worth client. The average Wealthfront high net worth investor has a liquid net worth greater than $1 million and a risk score of 7.5 for a static investment plan, i.e., without a glide path. The 529 glide path investment plan with approximately equivalent risk (as measured by average expected volatility) is risk score 9.0, which has an average expected return of 4.7% over 18 years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; line-height: 12px;\">Actual investors in Wealthfront may experience different results from the results upon which we based our calculations.
