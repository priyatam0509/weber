Investment strategies that feel right seldom are. A classic example of this is how to deal with market volatility. During a <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/wealthfront\/dropbox-investment-seminar\" target=\"_blank\">recent investment seminar<\/a> I gave to Dropbox employees, I asked the audience which type of market they would prefer to invest in periodically each year&nbsp;if they didn\u2019t intend to withdraw their money until 10 years from now.

That\u2019s because in effect you\u2019re buying the ETF at a steep discount. It doesn&#8217;t matter that the ETF declined during your investment period.

That doesn\u2019t mean you should wait for a volatile market to invest, because it\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/top-investor-mistake-time-market\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">almost impossible to time the market<\/a>. The lesson is you should ignore the behavior of the market if you intend to invest steadily and don&#8217;t plan on touching the vast majority of your account value for a number of years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Markets generally rise over time. So if your investment horizon is fairly long (at least 5 years) then what happens in between doesn\u2019t matter very much as long as your portfolio is ultimately worth more than what you paid for it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>People Are Driven by Fear of Loss<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So what accounts for these fears? In the case of volatile markets, Prof. <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/meir-statman-on-what-investors-really-want\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Meir Statman<\/a>, a member of Wealthfront\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/investment-team\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">investment team<\/a> has argued that people tend to extrapolate from their previous experiences of investment loss and apply these emotions to the present day. A market drop, even a fairly small one, brings up investors\u2019 memories of loss, probably from the 2008 financial crisis. Investors then conclude, based on the emotional memory, that their outcome will be just as bad as it was in 2008 \u2013 when most everyone lost money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That simply is not the case: There is no reason to believe that this period of volatility signals a big market drop. (Remember: <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/top-investor-mistake-time-market\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">No one can effectively predict<\/a> big market drops). Thus, the emotion of fear \u2013 specifically fear of investment loss \u2013 hampers investors\u2019 rational judgment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Vivid Memories Overly Affect Your Judgment<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We hope this post, which was inspired by an example cited in <em>Elements of Investing<\/em>, by our CIO, <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/tax-efficient-asset-classes-location\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Burt Malkiel<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/charley-ellis-joins-wealthfront\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Charley Ellis<\/a>, a member of our investment team, shows how little effect current market conditions have on the eventual outcome of your investments. What\u2019s important is making a schedule of regular investments and sticking to it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some millennials may be particularly prone to fears about investing, especially because their experience with investing was established during the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you let fear keep you from investing, you will miss out on years of returns and more importantly the <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/young-investors-timing-market\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">value of compounding<\/a>, which is greatest when you are young.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Refraining from investing in a volatile market is yet another example of how what feels right isn\u2019t necessarily the right thing to do when it comes to investing.
