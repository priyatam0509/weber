Somehow, they\u2019re still around today. Maybe one still falls out of Grandma\u2019s birthday card each year. Maybe it\u2019s how you get your tax refund. Checks are, frankly, a pretty quaint way to receive funds in the era of Venmo, Apple Pay, and electronic transfers. But they do show up from time to time, and when they do, you need to be able to deposit them.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>We\u2019re happy to announce you can now deposit a check into your Wealthfront Cash Account directly from your phone.<\/strong> This means you can skip the annoying trip to your nearest bank or ATM. Even in the best of times, checks often end up collecting dust until you finally have the time to deal with them. These days, visits to the bank involve reduced hours, plexiglass barriers, and industrial-sized bottles of hand sanitizer. With Wealthfront, you can deposit checks from the comfort of your own home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>How does <\/strong>it<strong> work?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Depositing a check with the Wealthfront app is easy and completely free. Just open the app and select the transfer icon at the bottom of the main dashboard. Click \u201cDeposit a check.\u201d Then you can photograph your check and confirm your deposit. The whole process takes just a few taps on your phone, and we\u2019ll notify you once your check is accepted.

And we\u2019re not done yet \u2013 you can look forward to more new features coming soon (like the ability to send a check from the Wealthfront app) that make the Cash Account an even better hub for your cash.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Wealthfront, we\u2019re <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wealthfronts-new-mission\/\">building a financial system that favors people, not institutions<\/a>, and that starts with reinventing banking.
