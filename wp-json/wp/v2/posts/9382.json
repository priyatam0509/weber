Today, we\u2019re thrilled to announce a strategic partnership with <strong>Intuit<\/strong> that will help us deliver more value to you and make it even easier to understand <em>and<\/em> manage your finances.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve followed our blog, you know we have high standards when it comes to forging partnerships. It\u2019s hard to find like minded financial services companies that put their clients first. Intuit is a dream partner. They don\u2019t just pay lip service to caring about their clients. They constantly challenge themselves to provide more value through technology-based services. And that\u2019s something we love.<\/p>\n<h2>Integration with TurboTax Data<\/h2>\n<p>In the first phase of our partnership, we\u2019ll be launching an integration with TurboTax data. Now, when you open a Wealthfront account you\u2019ll be able to securely connect your TurboTax account to instantly pre-fill essential fields like income, employer and a number of others, halving the number of fields you need to manually enter. This will make our account opening process even more streamlined, meaning you\u2019ll be on your way to saving and investing that much faster.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-9392\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/Intuit_Large.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1440\" height=\"900\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Higher Fidelity Financial Planning &amp; Advice<\/h2>\n<p>We\u2019ve been hard at work increasing the breadth of our automated financial planning and now offer services that allow you to plan for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/retirement\">retirement<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/home-planning\">save to buy a home<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/college\">save to send your child to their dream college<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/time-off-travel\">take time off<\/a> to travel the world.
