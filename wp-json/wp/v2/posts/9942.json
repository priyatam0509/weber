Read more about it <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/the-wealthfront-cash-account-apy-is-decreasing-to-0-10-percent\/\">here<\/a>\n.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p>Since we launched our cash account, we\u2019ve been asked one question far more often than any other: how are we able to get you 2.24% APY interest on your money, especially considering that traditional banks only pay 0.10% APY on average? The answer is simple: Those banks are <em>able<\/em> to pay more, too \u2014 they just don\u2019t. We get you more, in short, because we\u2019re not greedy. Banks could easily pay rates comparable to 2.24% APY, but they don\u2019t because they have learned they can get away with it.<\/p>\n<p>To understand why banks <em>could<\/em> pay more, you need to understand how banks make money. Consumer focused banks use deposits as the source of money to make their loans, which means their profits are primarily determined by the interest earned from consumer loans (primarily home equity lines, otherwise known as HELOCs) minus the interest paid on cash accounts. Bank profit margins grow when the interest rates they charge on loans increase faster than the interest rates they pay on deposits.<\/p>\n<p>This is illustrated in the graph below that plots average interest rate banks charge for HELOCs compared to the average interest rate they pay on savings accounts. As you can see, banks increase the interest rates they charge every time interest rates are increased by the Federal Reserve.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-10018\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/HELOC-vs.-Savings-640x450.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/HELOC-vs.-Savings-640x450.png 640w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/HELOC-vs.-Savings-768x540.png 768w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/HELOC-vs.-Savings-754x530.png 754w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/HELOC-vs.-Savings.png 1681w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The interest rates banks pay have effectively been the same for the past 10 years, a timeline that begins when banks lowered interest rates to zero as a result of the financial crisis and learned they did not lose depositors. Even worse, banks are not at all embarrassed to admit they want to further increase the spread between the rates they charge and the rates they pay.<\/p>\n<p>Below is a slide from a recent Charles Schwab investor presentation. It shows that they have passed along to clients a much lower percentage of the interest they\u2019ve earned this decade vs last decade and that their expectation is to continue to do so. In fact, Schwab has made a point in every one of its recent investor conference calls that they intend to generate expanding margins as interest rates rise. If this model just doesn\u2019t feel right to you, you\u2019re not alone. This is the core of why most consumers hate their banks. More and more people are aware of the role they play in generating massive profits for banks, with effectively no benefit to them.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-9944\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/image-640x357.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"357\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/image-640x357.png 640w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/image-768x428.png 768w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/image-950x530.png 950w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This is why banks are so hated, and it isn\u2019t just a vague feeling in the air. This growing dissatisfaction from consumers is reflected in banks\u2019 Net Promoter Scores (NPS). NPS is the best way to measure the likelihood a consumer will recommend their vendor to a friend. It is calculated by asking a consumer to rank the likelihood they would recommend the vendor on a scale of 0 to 5, with 5 being the highest score, and then subtracting the aggregate percentage that score 0 to 3 from the percentage of people who ranked the service as a 5. A score of 75 is outstanding (think Netflix), and 10 is terrible. According to <a href=\"https:\/\/npsbenchmarks.com\">NPS Benchmarks<\/a>, consumer-focused banks earn the lowest NPS of any industry. In fact, their average NPS is negative.<\/p>\n<p>Banks could still enjoy very generous margins even if they bumped up the interest rate on depositors\u2019 accounts in equal proportion to the increased interest they charge borrowers when the Federal Reserve increases rates. In other words, if the slopes of the two lines in the graph were equal. Where they diverge is a visual representation of the greed and arrogance that fuel banks\u2019 firm belief that they can get away with taking as much as possible, in plain sight of the consumers they\u2019re consciously short-changing.<\/p>\n<p>So now let\u2019s connect all of this to Wealthfront and the <a href=\"https:\/\/wealthfront.com\/cash\">2.24% APY interest rate on the Wealthfront FDIC-insured Cash Account<\/a>. The fact that we get for you what banks <em>could<\/em> offer you but won\u2019t is both a matter of choice \u2014 we actually believe in building an environment wherein our clients feel like people and not resources to be drained for profit \u2014 and a product of our business model. One tremendously valuable aspect of Wealthfront being software-based is that we\u2019re able to pass along most, if not all, of any potential rate increase in the future. It also means that the rates on Wealthfront accounts will drop if overall interest rates drop in the future, but that is highly unlikely to happen for quite a while based on expectations set by the Federal Reserve. Even then, our rates should remain much higher than what you\u2019ll find at the average bank.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes down to it, having an interest rate on our cash accounts that\u2019s so high it begs explanation isn\u2019t an accident or a fluke \u2014 it\u2019s a direct result of the values that drive Wealthfront as a whole. We want you to have your money right where you need it as part of your investment planning, and we want it growing as fast as possible. And if we had to guess, we would say this is far from the last time we\u2019ll surprise everyone with how our business decisions prioritize our clients\u2019 bottom line in a way that banks never have and likely never will.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Since we launched our cash account, we\u2019ve been asked one question far more often than any other: how are we able to get you 2.24% APY interest on your money, especially considering that traditional banks only pay 0.10% APY on average?
