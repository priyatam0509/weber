On average, IPO stocks recover from the trough of that day in the next day or two, and some \u2013 as highlighted in this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/blog\/real-data-based-guidance-on-selling-stock-post-ipo\/\">related post<\/a> \u2013 sustain their rebounds over time.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/04\/prices.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/04\/prices.png\" alt=\"prices\" width=\"620\" height=\"450\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Because many employees emerge from an IPO with a significant amount of their wealth tied up in their company\u2019s stock, they are in a position of having to determine how to diversify their portfolios after the lockup &#8212; the time period immediately after an IPO during which insiders cannot sell.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, not all stock prices rebound even immediately after that post-lockup trough. The bottom quintile of stock-price performers in the 20 days before and after the lockup doesn&#8217;t ever rebound during that time period. On average, however, most stocks hit a trough on the first day &#8212; and if you can avoid selling at the trough, do so.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/04\/one-day1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4176 alignleft\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/04\/one-day1.png\" alt=\"one-day\" width=\"158\" height=\"215\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how we reached this conclusion: We calculated the one-day return and one-day volume growth on the first day of lockup expiration for each of the 254 tech IPOs from 2000-2011. We also took the average across all the IPOs. As a reference point, we calculated the one-day return of the S&amp;P 500\u00ae on the same days, and took the average.<\/p>\n<p>As the following graph shows, the S&amp;P 500 is essentially flat, whereas the IPOs\u2019 return is -1.15%. In the meanwhile, the IPOs\u2019 trading volume rose by 178% on average, <em>i.e.<\/em>, almost tripling the trading volume compared with that of the lockup period.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to say exactly what is behind the post-lockup trough. In some cases, where a company&#8217;s stock price has declined over the previous three months, employee-insiders may be dumping their shares. In other cases, employees may simply have decided to escape the concentrated risk of having a portfolio that consists mainly of their company&#8217;s stock as soon as they can.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/04\/volume3.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4177\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/04\/volume3.png\" alt=\"volume\" width=\"620\" height=\"339\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>In either case, however, the lesson is clear. On average, it is smart <em>not<\/em> to panic and sell your shares as soon as possible.<\/p>\n<p><em>Graphics by Jared Jacobs.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Editor&#8217;s note: Interested in learning more about equity compensation, the best time to exercise options, and the right company stock selling strategies?
