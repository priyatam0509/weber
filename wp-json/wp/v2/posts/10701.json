Many of the recent pieces have encouraged readers to consider using Certificates of Deposit (\u201cCDs\u201d) as a compelling alternative to a liquid savings account to maintain their interest rates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While there\u2019s obvious surface appeal to a fixed interest rate that\u2019s typically higher than what you\u2019ll see on a savings account, there are serious reasons to take pause before thinking that putting your money in a CD is the safest way to ride out falling interest rates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some background: a Certificate of Deposit (CD) is a savings certificate with a fixed&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/m\/maturitydate.asp\">maturity date<\/a>&nbsp;and specified fixed interest rate that can be issued in any denomination aside from minimum investment requirements. CDs are generally issued by commercial banks and are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) up to $250,000 per individual. Term lengths \u2014 the length of time you agree to leave your deposit in the bank \u2014 on CDs usually range from a few months up to 10 years. Withdrawals made before the maturity are most likely subject to penalties.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>CDs are meant for money you don\u2019t plan on needing in the short term.&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Liquidity, as you likely know, is the term we use to refer to how quickly you can get access to your cash assets. It is an extremely important factor to consider when <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/4-signs-you-have-too-much-cash\/\">deciding where to save your cash<\/a>. In fact, liquidity is one of the two key things everyone must think about when deciding how much of their money to put into what kinds of accounts at various times: accessibility and interest rate.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s how the relationship between these two factors typically works out: The longer your money is locked up, the higher the rate you should be paid. But earning a higher rate may not be a higher priority than liquidity for your particular situation. For example, if you are saving for a home that you want to purchase in the next year or so, you would be ill-advised to lock your money up in the meantime, even if just for a year. What if your ideal home comes on the market in nine months, and you\u2019re unable to access your savings to make your down payment? Similarly, it might seem like a great idea to put your emergency fund in an account that earns a higher rate, but if that rate comes with the stipulation that the funds are locked up for a set period of time, that money is not of much value if the emergency for which you saved occurs in the interim.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fact is, high interest rates are wonderful \u2014 as long as you still have access to the cash you need <em>when <\/em>you need it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s compare the numbers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/WF_July2019_Chart_R2-01-1023x530.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10873\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Since interest rates are correlated with duration of CDs, you typically find that you earn a higher rate for a longer required lockup period. This is born out in the table below that compares a fully liquid Wealthfront Cash Account to a traditional savings account, a one-year CD, and a two-year CD. As you can see, the rates on CDs are much higher than what you can get from a traditional savings account, but they require your money to be locked up for the term length, and they usually also require a hefty minimum account size (typically the higher the minimum, the higher the rate).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn\u2019t to say that CDs are inherently a bad option. That\u2019s far from the truth. A CD can be an appropriate destination for your cash, but only if you\u2019re certain you don\u2019t need the money for that time period, and the CD pays a significant earnings advantage compared to available liquid alternatives. Think of every expense you might need cash for in the next few years \u2014 those funds may not be better off in a CD, and a cut to interest rates doesn\u2019t change that. Again, it\u2019s about balancing accessibility and growth potential, the two pillars of cash allocation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>So how much of an interest rate advantage does a CD need to offer in order to be worth opting for it versus a high-yield cash account?&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The amount of premium needed is subject to personal tastes, but it\u2019s very hard to say that current one- and two-year CDs are justified over what Wealthfront\u2019s Cash Account offers, especially when you take account minimums into consideration. And honestly, even for money you <em>don\u2019t <\/em>need in the next few years, a CD still might not be the best option.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s also worth remembering that savings accounts and CDs are not your only choices. Let\u2019s say you have a chunk of cash that you don\u2019t plan to use for at least three to five years. In that case, a diversified investment account is likely a better option than a CD. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/articles\/investing\/122215\/cds-vs-inflation-are-they-keeping.asp\">Current rates on CDs are not much higher than the current inflation rate<\/a>, so you are not necessarily gaining any meaningful buying power by saving your cash there. A way to grow your buying power is to invest in an equity oriented diversified portfolio. This isn\u2019t our advice <em>because <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/investing\">Wealthfront offers a portfolio like this<\/a> \u2014 we offer it because it\u2019s such a favorable option for our clients to house the funds they don\u2019t need near-term access to. Based on historical performance, the expected annual long-term net of fee return associated with an investment account (not including the benefits of tax-loss harvesting) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nerdwallet.com\/blog\/investing\/average-stock-market-return\/\">could be as high as 10%<\/a>, which more than justifies the risk if these funds are left alone for at least three to five years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each type of savings account has a particular intended use case. This is an immovable fact that gets diluted by reactionary advice encouraging consumers to run from one high interest rate to the next without thoughtful, strategic consideration about what their <em>actual <\/em>needs are, including determining the amount of liquidity that they personally need. This important nuance so often gets ignored in financial advice tied to market events like rate cuts. So before you get enticed by the slightly higher rates offered by CDs, take a moment to digest all the options, weigh your own needs and priorities, and then decide what moves to make, if any. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Whenever interest rates decline, as they are expected to do at the end of this month, you are sure to see a slew of articles published that encourage consumers to forego immediate access to their money in favor of maintaining a higher rate of interest.
