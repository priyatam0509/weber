Read more about it <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/the-wealthfront-cash-account-apy-is-decreasing-to-0-10-percent\/\">here<\/a>\n.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Tuesday, March 3 the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) lowered the target range for the federal funds rate by 0.50% to 1%\u20131.25% because of risks posed to the U.S. economy by the coronavirus, COVID-19. As we\u2019ve written in the past, a decrease in the fed funds rate means we need to decrease the interest rate we pay on the Wealthfront Cash Account, too. We are lowering our interest rate (APR) by 0.50%, <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/how-do-interest-rates-work-heres-everything-you-need-to-know\/\">which, due to compounding, translates to<\/a> an APY decrease of 0.51%. This means the APY on our Cash Account is changing from 1.78% to 1.27%. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Usually, interest rate cuts are communicated at the end of regularly scheduled FOMC meetings, which are held eight times a year. The next meeting is scheduled for March 17-18, but this surprise rate cut occurred off-cycle. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged the uncertainty COVID-19 has introduced in the economy and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.federalreserve.gov\/mediacenter\/files\/FOMCpresconf20200303.pdf\">expressed<\/a> that the Fed was lowering interest rates as part of its commitment to keeping the U.S. economy strong.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What does this mean for you?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the clearest terms, here\u2019s what a lower APY on your Wealthfront Cash Account means for your money: a 0.51% rate decrease means that every $1,000 in your account will now earn $5.10 less in annual interest.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why is the rate going down?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The partner banks where we broker our deposits pay us a rate based on a premium fixed to the fed funds rate. This means that <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/how-the-fed-funds-rate-impacts-the-wealthfront-cash-account\/\">when the fed funds rate declines, our rates also decline<\/a>. Because we are a broker-dealer, regulations do not allow us to pay out a rate in excess of what our partner banks pay us. This means we are forced to lower the rate on the Wealthfront Cash Account whenever the Fed lowers rates. We expect other financial institutions to lower their rates as well but it may not happen for a few weeks. If you\u2019re considering moving your funds to another high-yield account that has yet to lower rates, <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/why-rate-chasing-doesnt-pay\/\">check out our blog post<\/a> about why that may not be the best move.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even with a lower rate, you\u2019ll still enjoy everything else you love about your Wealthfront Cash Account, which comes with unlimited free transfers, no fees, and FDIC insurance up to $1 million through our partner banks. Late this spring, we\u2019ll add exciting new features to the Cash Account, including debit cards, direct deposit, and the ability to pay bills.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Our commitment to you<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We believe in helping our clients earn more money on all their money, and our commitment to you hasn\u2019t changed. We promise to be 100% transparent with you if anything changes and always pass on as much interest as we possibly can. We\u2019ll keep providing you with the best advice we can, no matter what.&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Note: As of , the Wealthfront Cash Account has a APY.
