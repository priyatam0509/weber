Here\u2019s a blog post that covers that question more in depth: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/blog\/real-data-based-guidance-on-selling-stock-post-ipo\/\">Real data-based guidance on selling stock post-IPO<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Some companies have more than one lockup expiration, which may help mitigate the lockup effect. For instance, in Zynga\u2019s case, the bulk of its shares offered in the IPO \u2013 325 million shares \u2013 will emerge from the lockup on May 30. But in early April, Zynga had a secondary offering of 200 million shares to build the float in order to attract new institutional investors. (We expect to have a blog post that discusses secondary offerings soon). The two lockups on that offering, of shares held by directors, officers and some select shareholders, will expire July 6 and Aug. 16.<\/p>\n<p><em>*The analysis contained in this infographic is based on publicly available data reviewed by Wealthfront for the years 2000 to 2011; past performance is no guarantee of future results.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Editor&#8217;s note: Interested in learning more about equity compensation, the best time to exercise options, and the right company stock selling strategies?
