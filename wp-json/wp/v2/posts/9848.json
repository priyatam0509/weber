It\u2019s the ideal way to address your short term goals like creating an emergency fund, saving for a car or even a home. Our cash account currently pays an interest rate of 2.24%, is FDIC insured for up to $1 million, and has a minimum of only $1. <strong>That\u2019s nearly 20 times the interest rate and 4 times the insurance you receive at a traditional bank.<\/strong><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9850\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/Blog_Comparison.png\" alt=\"Wealthfront vs Industry Average\" width=\"736\" height=\"377\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/Blog_Comparison.png 736w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/Blog_Comparison-640x328.png 640w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/Blog_Comparison-704x361.png 704w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 736px) 100vw, 736px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>And while we always recommend <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/sound-investing-when-markets-are-in-turmoil\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">staying the course in long-term investing<\/a>, we understand if the recent market volatility is making you hesitant to invest right now. Our cash account is the perfect place to stash your cash until you\u2019re ready again. You can\u2019t beat the security and return our cash account offers. Additionally, unlike your bank account, <strong>we charge no fees, our service has no market risk, you get more interest as interest rates rise, <em>and<\/em> you have unlimited free transfers each month.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>$260 million in your pockets<\/h2>\n<p>When designing our cash account, we saw an enormous opportunity to build a new model that actually <em>benefits<\/em> you. In 2018 the four largest banks in the U.S. made over $300 billion in revenue while your deposits just sat in your checking and savings accounts and earned almost nothing \u2014 your money makes money for your bank while doing nothing for <em>you<\/em>. What do you get in exchange? Overdraft fees, account maintenance fees, and confusing services that force you to go into a branch or dial a call center. Not exactly an equal relationship.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-9851 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/Blog_5year-530x530.png\" alt=\"Cash account over 5 years\" width=\"430\" height=\"430\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/Blog_5year-530x530.png 530w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/Blog_5year-500x500.png 500w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/Blog_5year-768x768.png 768w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/Blog_5year.png 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px\" \/><br \/>\n<em>The line graph is shown for illustrative purposes only.
