Not only are there costs associated with making trades, like commissions, but the human tendency is to buy and sell at the wrong times. The more often you trade, the higher your risk of making a timing mistake.)<\/p>\n<p>In a guest post that the <a title=\"Zack Miller on gender and investing\" href=\"http:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/85broads\/2012\/02\/13\/why-married-couples-should-look-over-their-portfolios-together\/\" target=\"_blank\">Upfront Blog supplied to 85 Broads<\/a>, Zack Miller wrote about some more recent research that suggests that men and women invest best together.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><em>A <a href=\"http:\/\/papers.ssrn.com\/sol3\/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1670612&amp;http:\/\/papers.ssrn.com\/sol3\/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1670612&amp;http:\/\/papers.ssrn.com\/sol3\/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1670612\">study<\/a> on investing patterns in marriage and divorce showed that members of a married couple adjust the portfolio\u2019s risk profile to jive better with their partner\u2019s tolerance for volatility. Married men dial risk down and hitched women tend to own more stocks than they would when they were single.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>And that spells more stock market participation for married couples than for single men and women. In fact, married couples generally perform better than single men and women, at least when it comes to retirement investing.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em> Examining nearly seven thousand retirement accounts, researchers <a title=\"&quot;Portfolio Choice, Trading, and Returns in a Large 401(k) Plan&quot;\" href=\"http:\/\/papers.ssrn.com\/sol3\/papers.cfm?abstract_id=252048\" target=\"_blank\">found<\/a> that married couples had 42.88% of their portfolios in stocks while unmarried people averaged only 36.52%. That exposure to the stock market\u2013 combined with less male-driven trading \u2014 means married couples in that same research performed better than single (8.92% per year versus 8.16%).<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em> When men and women work together on the investing equation, the whole turns out to be greater than the sum of the parts.
