The dream wedding. The dream kitchen. The dream vacation.<\/p>\n<p>All too often pursuing these dreams is a total nightmare.<\/p>\n<p>Why? Because the typical options available for getting the money you need to make these dreams a reality aren\u2019t that great. If you own a home you can pursue a home equity line of credit (HELOC), but that process often takes weeks and comes with a ton of paperwork \u2013\u00a0and there\u2019s no guarantee you\u2019ll actually get the loan. Alternatively, you can take money out of your investment account, but you may have to pay taxes on the withdrawal (not to mention shrinking your nest egg!).<\/p>\n<p>But at Wealthfront we think differently. We want you to have your cake and eat it too.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why today we are excited to launch a new service that is our first foray into personal banking. Introducing\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/portfolio-line-of-credit\"><strong>Portfolio Line of Credit<\/strong><\/a>. We live in a world of \u201cinstant delivery,\u201d from taxis to groceries to handymen. So why not add lines of credit to the mix? At Wealthfront we want our clients to be able to borrow what they need, when they need it, directly from their smartphones.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Portfolio Line of Credit<\/strong> establishes a line of credit of up to 30% of your account value for Wealthfront clients with at least $100,000 invested in an individual or joint investment account. The best part? We do this instantly and without the hassle of paperwork &#8212; you\u2019re already approved when you open your account! It takes 30 seconds to sign up, and in many cases you get your money in 24 hours.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn.wealthfront.com\/public.email.images\/blog_ploclaunch.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"476\" height=\"984\" \/><\/p>\n<p>But there\u2019s more good stuff: we offer this line of credit at interest rates well below traditional alternatives, like HELOCs. How? Because your line of credit is secured by your own investments. In fact, you get an even better interest rate the more you have invested in your Wealthfront account. Oh, and you repay on your own timeline. Interest accrues and is added to your monthly balance, but you pay back the loan when it works for you. How\u2019s that for flexibility?<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-8656 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Screen-Shot-2018-04-12-at-12.14.51-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"586\" height=\"351\" \/><\/p>\n<h6 style=\"text-align: center;\">Source: Bankrate, April 2018 | *In some select cases the interest from a HELOC may be tax-deductible<\/h6>\n<p>Our goal at Wealthfront is to keep innovating so that you can live your best life.
