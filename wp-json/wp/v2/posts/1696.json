Wealthfront recently created a slide show presentation, which we show to various companies around Silicon Valley through our <a title=\"Wealthfront Investing Seminars\" href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/seminars\" target=\"_blank\">seminar program<\/a>, offering a primer in how to use Modern Portfolio Theory to combine ETFs. We hope that watching it helps you put your own diversified portfolio together, or enables you to ask an investment advisor better questions.<\/p>\n<div id=\"__ss_10659371\" style=\"width: 425px\"><strong style=\"margin: 12px 0 4px\"><a title=\"Engineer Your Portfolio with ETFs\" href=\"http:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/wealthfront\/engineering-your-portfolio-with-etfs\" target=\"_blank\">Engineer Your Portfolio with ETFs<\/a><\/strong> <iframe style=\"border: 1px solid #CCC;border-width: 1px 1px 0\" src=\"http:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/slideshow\/embed_code\/10659371\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"425\" height=\"355\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>The slide show complements our <a title=\"Online financial advisor Wealthfront's whitepaper\" href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/whitepapers\/investment-methodology\/\" target=\"_blank\">whitepaper<\/a> on our investing strategy.<\/p>\n<p>A couple of notes on Modern Portfolio Theory \u2013 which most individual investors have heard of, but few have taken the time to understand. Many institutional investors \u2013 the Yale Endowments of the world &#8212; base their investing strategies on Modern Portfolio Theory. <a title=\"Wikipedia on Nobel Prize-winning economist, Harry Markowitz\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Harry_Markowitz\" target=\"_blank\">Harry Markowitz<\/a> introduced the theory in 1952, and in 1990 shared the Nobel Prize in Economics for its development with Merton Miller and William Sharpe, who, along with Wealthfront\u2019s co-founder Andy Rachleff, is a faculty member at Stanford Graduate School of Business.<\/p>\n<p>There has been a lot of work around Modern Portfolio Theory, but basically put, the theory prescribes combining asset classes that have different return, risk and correlation characteristics rather than choosing particular stocks or securities to maximize returns for any level of risk.<\/p>\n<p>Wealthfront uses the <a title=\"Black-Litterman Model for estimating returns and covariances for input to optimization models\" href=\"http:\/\/www.blacklitterman.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Black Litterman model<\/a> to estimate the inputs that need to be fed into a mean-variance optimization framework to find the ideal mixture of asset classes for each level of risk. The model is freely available through open source, although you must have at your disposal the data and a software development team that knows how to make it useable. (On another Nobel note, one of the creators of the Black Litterman model was Fischer Black, best known as the co-author of the Black Scholes option pricing model. Mr. Black died too soon to receive the Nobel for his work on the de facto standard for pricing all options; Myron Scholes accepted the prize in 1997. Robert Litterman was Mr. Fischer\u2019s collaborator on the Black Litterman model.)<\/p>\n<p>You might be wondering why we\u2019ve taken so much time to build a slide show that shows you how to construct your own diversified portfolio.
