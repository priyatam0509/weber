In less than a month since our public launch, clients have trusted us with over $1 billion in deposits, which has earned them over $2.5 million in interest. And now a great thing is getting even better: We\u2019re raising the annual percentage yield (APY) on our cash account from 2.24% to 2.29%. That means our APY is over 22 times the national average and higher than Ally Bank, Marcus Savings, and Capital One. And you still get the same great insurance coverage that only Wealthfront offers \u2014 up to $1 million in FDIC coverage.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2400\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/blog_cash_apyincrease_1billion25million.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10246\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Not that we need to spell it out for you, but a higher APY is amazing news for Wealthfront clients.

It\u2019s simple \u2014 passing more on to our clients is in our company DNA. As our service scales, we benefit from cost savings that we\u2019ll <em>always<\/em> pass on to you.

The 2.29% APY on our cash accounts might seem like just a nice thing, but it\u2019s so much bigger than that \u2014 it\u2019s symptomatic of everything that makes Wealthfront more transparent and client-driven. In the last quarter of 2018 alone, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-usa-banks-results\/u-s-banks-record-59-1-billion-in-profits-in-fourth-quarter-of-2018-idUSKCN1QA2LK\">U.S. banks made over $59 billion in profits<\/a> while your cash sat around in their accounts earning you next to nothing. The Wealthfront business model puts your interests first. That\u2019s just not how traditional banks are built. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What does your bank have that we <em>won\u2019t <\/em>give you? Overdraft fees, account maintenance fees, and confusing services that force you to go into a branch or dial a call center. We doubt you\u2019ll miss them.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Worried this news comes with some hidden downside? (It\u2019s okay, we can\u2019t blame you for not trusting financial institutions. You\u2019ve seen their dark side.)

Next up on our roadmap: effortless transfers between your Wealthfront accounts, auto bill pay, direct deposit, and debit\/ATM cards.<strong> <\/strong>We\u2019ve heard what you want, we\u2019ve imagined an integrated ecosystem of investment and cash accounts that gives it to you, and that\u2019s become the true north we\u2019re building toward every day.
