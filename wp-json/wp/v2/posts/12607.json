It also means the deadline to make a 2019 contribution to your IRA (individual retirement account) is getting closer. You have until April 15 to contribute for 2019, but maybe you\u2019re not sure where to start. One of the most common questions we get from our clients is about what kind of IRA they should use. The answer depends on your personal situation, so we built our IRA Account Selection Tool to help you decide.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/ira-calculator\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Image-Pasted-at-2020-2-25-12-07.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-12618\" width=\"580\" height=\"62\"\/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>IRAs are a popular way to save for retirement, and with good reason \u2014 depending on the kind of IRA you use, they come with numerous benefits. Here, we\u2019ll break down three benefits of IRAs and one drawback. First, let\u2019s look at the benefits.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Benefit #1: They come with more investment options than your 401(k)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a 401(k), you\u2019ve probably already noticed that employer-provided retirement plans don\u2019t give you many choices when it comes to deciding how your money gets invested (the fees are likely high too \u2014 more on that later). Maybe you assume IRAs work the same way since they\u2019re also a type of retirement account. This couldn\u2019t be further from the truth: IRAs, much like taxable investment accounts, come with many investment options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Benefit #2: They\u2019re more flexible than you think<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Roth IRAs come with a surprising amount of flexibility. For the most part, you shouldn\u2019t put any money you might need before retirement into a 401(k) because once it\u2019s in the account, you\u2019ll need to pay a penalty (and taxes) in order to withdraw it. The same goes for traditional IRAs. Roth IRAs, however, offer you more liquidity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a Roth IRA, you can withdraw contributions early without paying additional taxes or a penalty. However, you may still owe income tax and a 10% penalty on earnings you take out of your Roth IRA before retirement. Still, this flexibility can offer you some peace of mind if you\u2019re debating contributing to a Roth IRA.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a traditional IRA, you might be able to execute a <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/should-you-consider-a-roth-ira-conversion\/\">Roth conversion<\/a> and benefit from the superior liquidity that comes with a Roth IRA. (And don\u2019t forget! <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wealthfront-now-offers-easy-roth-conversions\/\">Wealthfront offers easy Roth conversions<\/a>.)&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Benefit #3: The fees are usually low<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At Wealthfront, <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/fees-can-destroy-return\/\">we think it\u2019s important to minimize fees<\/a>. When you invest, you\u2019ll typically pay for what\u2019s known as the expense ratio (the cost of owning a given ETF) as well as advisory fees. It\u2019s important to keep an eye on the fees you\u2019re paying, because over time they can really eat into your return.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Average 401(k) fees are generally <a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/articles\/personal-finance\/061913\/hidden-fees-401ks.asp\">between 0.5% and 2%<\/a> (ouch). IRAs, on the other hand, are typically much less expensive. Wealthfront\u2019s IRAs are subject to our low 0.25% annual advisory fee.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s one downside of IRAs you should be aware of.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Drawback: The contribution limits are much lower<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While you can deduct up to $19,500 of contributions to a 401(k) plan in 2020, you can only contribute and deduct $6,000 for an IRA (or $7,000 if you are at least 50 years old). If you are covered by a 401(k) plan at work, you can\u2019t deduct contributions to your traditional IRA for 2019 if your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) is more than $74,000 as a single filer or $123,000 as a married couple filing jointly. If you\u2019re not covered by a 401(k) plan but your spouse is, you can\u2019t deduct traditional IRA contributions if your MAGI is $203,000 or more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Choosing the right kind of IRA<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>IRAs are an excellent account type to consider as you make a plan to save for retirement. We know these decisions can feel overwhelming, which is why we developed a tool to help you decide. Enter your information into our<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/ira-calculator\"> IRA Account Selection Tool<\/a> to determine what kind of IRA is right for you.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if you are a single filer who is 30 years old and has an income of $160,000, a 401(k) plan at work, and no money in a traditional IRA, our tool can tell you to set up a backdoor Roth.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or, if you\u2019re married and filing jointly with a household income of $200,000, have access to a 401(k) at work, and have money in a traditional IRA, our tool will tell you to plan for a reduced contribution limit of $1,800 to a Roth IRA. Our IRA Account Selection Tool takes the guesswork out of IRA contributions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/ira-calculator\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"69\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Image-Pasted-at-2020-2-25-12-07-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-12619\"\/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This tool is just one more way Wealthfront helps set you up for a more secure and rewarding future.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Tax season is here, and you\u2019re likely in the process of getting your 2019 tax return ready.
