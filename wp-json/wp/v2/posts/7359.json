You go from being single and worrying mainly about rent and student loans to feeling a bit overwhelmed. Suddenly, you have a mortgage to pay, joint finances, and kids\u2026 don\u2019t forget kids. Man, do they change things. With two girls under the age of five, I can definitely relate.<\/p>\n<p>So when the subject of retirement comes up with our clients, I understand how it can be easy to put off an event that is 30 years down the road. Life gets in the way. After all, you have time to make it up, right? When it comes to reaching your goals in retirement, time is your biggest ally. So how does Wealthfront, as your financial advisor, make you care about something that is 30 years away? How do we make \u201cplanning for your future\u201d less intimidating? How do we make it *gulp* fun? Today, we are extremely excited to announce that we have done just that.<\/p>\n<h2>A Financial Plan Built for You<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/path\">Introducing Path<\/a>, by Wealthfront, a better way to experience financial planning. Path helps you prepare for your financial future, every step of the way. You can set up Path in five minutes and get answers right away to big questions:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Can I live my current lifestyle in retirement?<\/li>\n<li>How much will I be worth then?<\/li>\n<li>How much should I be saving today?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/200751283?app_id=122963\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" title=\"Meet Path by Wealthfront\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h2>What&#8217;s Your Path?<\/h2>\n<p>Many clients don&#8217;t know what their financial goals should be, and even more don&#8217;t realize that the goals they\u2019ve set with their current spending and saving patterns are actually unattainable. This is no fault of theirs. There are no great options to forecast your financial future outside of maybe using one of those static \u201cretirement calculators\u201d that make you do a lot of guesswork. We were determined to build something more personal, connected and instant than any financial advisor could ever be. Path takes advantage of our team of PhDs to analyze your past behavior from connecting to your financial accounts, showing you what&#8217;s possible for your future.<\/p>\n<p>As your financial advisor, it&#8217;s our job to sometimes be the bad guy and tell you that you can&#8217;t necessarily afford the lifestyle you want. So we designed Path to first assess your basic financial health, before we let you imagine what\u2019s possible. We start with your needs before we get to your wants and wishes for one simple reason: If the foundation is shaky, then the rest is irrelevant. Let\u2019s make sure your foundation is strong.<\/p>\n<h2>Path Lets You Focus on What You Can Control Today<\/h2>\n<p>We\u2019ve put in the work to allow you to focus on what really matters; the money you save and spend now has a dramatic impact on your financial future.<\/p>\n<p>One of the hardest parts of financial planning involves knowing what assumptions to make about the future. Path eliminates that challenge by leveraging the brainpower of our team of PhDs to handle the most difficult assumptions for you, like social security, inflation and investment returns. We then use your actual behavior to forecast the future; not what you say you want to do, but what you are actually doing. Path uses your real transaction history to calculate a rolling 12-month average of how much you\u2019ve been saving and spending. Let\u2019s say you decide to send your kids to private schools and end up saving less now \u2013 you don\u2019t have to tell us. We already know. It\u2019s in the data, and we will adjust our advice accordingly.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/path\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-7361\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/phd-research.png\" alt=\"phd-research\" width=\"737\" height=\"326\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/phd-research.png 983w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/phd-research-640x283.png 640w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/phd-research-768x340.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 737px) 100vw, 737px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Financial Planning at Your Fingertips<\/h2>\n<p>We think the current industry standard of meeting with a financial advisor twice a year is pretty dehumanizing. We want to empower you to get answers on your own time. No need for in person meetings, scheduled phone calls or awkward Skype sessions. That\u2019s why it was crucial for us to build the <strong>first fully mobile financial planning experience<\/strong>. We can\u2019t answer all of life\u2019s questions for you, but we can be there if you\u2019re zoning out on the train thinking about how life might unfold. We built Path so you can jump in no matter where you are to see how different decisions could impact your financial future.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/path\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn.wealthfront.com\/public.email.images\/blog_path_demograph.gif\" width=\"300\" height=\"595\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Explore Life\u2019s &#8220;What Ifs&#8221; with Path<\/h2>\n<p>Your life could play out in many different ways, and there is no &#8220;right answer&#8221; to what the perfect plan may be. There\u2019s no piece of paper with a magic number on it because life doesn\u2019t work that way. Whether you\u2019re in line for coffee or at the dinner table with your spouse, we designed Path to allow you to explore what\u2019s possible and dream up many different scenarios to find the best path for you.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Savings <\/strong>&#8211; You work hard. Really hard. And a year from now you finally get that promotion you\u2019ve been gunning for, along with a nice raise. Suddenly, you\u2019re in a position where you can save more. Path lets you explore how what you save today impacts your long-term outcome.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/path\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn.wealthfront.com\/public.email.images\/blog_path_demograph2.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"736\" height=\"293\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>When it comes to saving, not all accounts are created equal, so we prioritize contributions to tax-advantaged, low-fee accounts, and we automatically take relevant annual limits into account. When you\u2019re ready to commit to increased monthly savings, Path will show you which accounts you should allocate your savings to and how much to allocate to each across your Wealthfront and non-Wealthfront accounts.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/path\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-7375\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/contribution-page.png\" alt=\"contribution page\" width=\"560\" height=\"524\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/contribution-page.png 861w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/contribution-page-534x500.png 534w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/contribution-page-768x719.png 768w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/contribution-page-566x530.png 566w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Spending<\/strong> &#8211; You\u2019re fresh off that big promotion, thinking that when you retire you may be able to live lavishly and travel the world.

This is intentional for two reasons. As your advisor, we want to tell you the right things to do, but above all we want you to understand that you have options. We want you to explore those options, try them on and see which one feels right. Additionally, reaching 100% of your savings goal might not be possible right now and that\u2019s okay. We&#8217;re not going to build a financial plan that is tone deaf and makes you feel inadequate every time you log in. Instead, when you are hovering over the graph, simply click on the dotted line and the savings number that gets you to 100% is revealed.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/path\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn.wealthfront.com\/public.email.images\/blog_path_demograph5.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"736\" height=\"289\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Let&#8217;s find your Path together<\/h2>\n<p>Our clients pay us not to call them.
