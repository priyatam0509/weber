If you\u2019re like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gobankingrates.com\/banking\/banks\/how-many-bank-accounts-americans-have\/\">half of Americans<\/a> and keep your money at more than one financial institution, you probably find yourself moving money between accounts, committing multiple logins to memory, and monitoring lots of transfers. Whether you use traditional banks, fintech companies, or a mix to manage your money, it can be exhausting to coordinate across clunky interfaces that don\u2019t work well together. This hassle is what inspired our vision of Self-Driving Money\u2122.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For years, we\u2019ve worked towards building a future where software would make it easy to manage your finances automatically \u2013 so they\u2019d become a point of pride, not a source of stress. We\u2019re thrilled to announce that Self-Driving Money\u2122 is finally here. <strong>The Wealthfront Cash Account now allows you to instantly organize your cash into categories and route your money exactly where you want it, so you can effortlessly manage your finances from end to end.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the moment your employer direct deposits your paycheck to your Cash Account, you can let our software handle the details \u2013 it will automatically keep money for everyday spending (like paying bills), <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/you-can-now-send-a-check-from-the-wealthfront-app\/\">send checks<\/a> as needed, top off your emergency fund and other savings goals, and even <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/invest-within-minutes-transfer-cash-to-investment-account\/\">invest money within minutes<\/a> so you can build long-term wealth. When you build your savings plan, we\u2019ll apply our industry-leading automation so your money gets routed automatically with no extra effort on your part. It\u2019s a whole new way to make your money work for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>You make the rules, we\u2019ll automate them<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It takes just a few taps to organize your cash into categories and build an automated plan to route your paycheck \u2013 both are extremely flexible and you can edit them at any time. For example, let\u2019s say you want a category to save up an <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/build-emergency-fund\/\">emergency fund<\/a> (which we think is a great idea!). You can set a target total balance for your emergency fund (or a monthly saving target) and our software will automatically move money to meet that goal while ensuring you have enough for everyday spending.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, you\u2019re probably saving for more than one thing. Our software takes the work out of routing money to multiple goals. In addition to saving for an emergency fund, maybe you also want to save for the down payment on a home. You can create another category and update your plan so that cash gets automatically routed to both categories instantly to meet your specific needs. You might also decide you want all excess cash to go to your emergency fund until you hit your target balance, and <em>then<\/em> start saving for a down payment \u2013 that\u2019s fine, too, and it\u2019s easy to set up.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"489\" height=\"530\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-1.26.01-PM-489x530.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13966\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-1.26.01-PM-489x530.png 489w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-1.26.01-PM-461x500.png 461w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-1.26.01-PM-768x832.png 768w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Screen-Shot-2021-04-07-at-1.26.01-PM.png 1078w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 489px) 100vw, 489px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At Wealthfront, we want to save you both time and stress by simplifying the way you manage your money.
