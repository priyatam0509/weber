Using simulated returns for Wealthfront portfolios, we found that the investor who disregarded market performance and consistently invested outperformed in the long run.<\/p>\n<p><b>What Does Actual Client Behavior Show?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Wealthfront has the advantage of having access to actual client behavior and subsequent account performance. In the below analysis, we group clients based on their deposit-timing behavior and compare investment performance of each group.<\/p>\n<p>In order to capture the effect of deposit-timing on account performance, we look at the difference between an account\u2019s annualized <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/whats-your-rate-of-return-on-investment\/\">money-weighted return (MWR) and time-weighted return (TWR)<\/a>. MWR is the internal rate of return of a portfolio, which includes the impact of deposit timing (controlled by the client) as well as the investment strategy (controlled by the investment manager). TWR, on the other hand, is a measure of the compound rate of growth in a portfolio, which only accounts for impact of investment strategy and is not impacted by when deposits or withdrawals are made. Therefore, the difference between MWR and TWR represents the incremental impact of deposit-timing on account performance.<\/p>\n<p>We sort clients into three groups based on their deposit-timing behavior: contrarian, independent, and momentum. Contrarian investors tend to deposit following market declines, while momentum investors tend to deposit following market increases. The deposit pattern of independent investors is unrelated to the market return. Clients who set up repeating deposits are prime examples of independent investors, as their deposit decision is only related to the passage of time and not market performance.<\/p>\n<p>In order to assign each client to one of these three groups, we run a logistic regression to examine the influence of market performance on a client\u2019s decision to make a deposit. Regression results assign a coefficient to each client, which is a numerical score that represents their susceptibility to making deposits based on market performance. The greater the coefficient, the more likely the investor is to deposit after positive returns, relative to her average deposit frequency. Based on the estimated coefficient, investors are assigned to one of three groups: the bottom third are <i>contrarian investors<\/i>, the middle third are <i>independent investors<\/i>, the top third are <i>momentum investors<\/i>.<\/p>\n<p><b>Chasing the Market Hurts Returns<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The results below summarize the \u00a0average difference between the annualized MWR and TWR of accounts in each deposit-timing group over their full tenure as Wealthfront clients (accounts within each group are weighted equally). The results paint a consistent picture. The greater an investor\u2019s tendency to engage in performance chasing, the worse their economic outcome. The MWR of contrarian investors is 27 bps <i>above<\/i> their TWR, whereas the MWR of momentum investors is 14 bps <i>below<\/i> their TWR, with both results being statistically distinguishable from zero at the 1% significance level.* By contrast, the differential between the MWR and TWR is statistically indistinguishable from zero for independent investors.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Impact-of-deposit-timing.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-7115 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Impact-of-deposit-timing.png\" alt=\"impact-of-deposit-timing\" width=\"570\" height=\"446\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Impact-of-deposit-timing.png 1140w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Impact-of-deposit-timing-640x500.png 640w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Impact-of-deposit-timing-768x601.png 768w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/Impact-of-deposit-timing-677x530.png 677w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><b>Our Recommendation Remains the Same<\/b><\/p>\n<p>We recommend that clients do not let market performance and account returns influence their decision to make deposits. The above results clearly indicate that <b>a momentum strategy has a negative impact on returns<\/b>. And although a contrarian investor has performed better than an independent investor, the results are partially driven by the fact that all market declines over this time period have reversed, such that \u201cbuying the dips\u201d has emerged as a winning strategy.<\/p>\n<p>At Wealthfront, we believe that the financial markets are largely unpredictable in the short run and investors are better off focusing on the long run and investing consistently. A repeating deposit helps clients maintain discipline and stay the course, reaping the benefits of investment automation. While the contrarian strategy seems attractive, it\u2019s important to recognize that executing it requires an ongoing commitment to monitoring financial markets and overcoming behavioral biases to decide when and how much to invest as markets decline. A client who wishes to pursue this strategy would be well served by setting up a recurring deposit, and only then, making additional deposits when markets are down.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 10px;\">*t-statistics for (MWR-TWR) for contrarian investors and momentum investors are 5.80 and -3.25, respectively.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; line-height: 12px;\"><strong>Disclosure<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; line-height: 12px;\"><br \/>\nNothing in this article should be construed as tax advice, a solicitation or offer, or recommendation, to buy or sell any security.
