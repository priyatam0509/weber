Having debt can feel uncomfortable at best and often completely crushing, which is to say nothing of the chokehold it can have on your financial goals. It\u2019s so easy to feel like your \u201creal\u201d life can\u2019t start until you unburden yourself of the debt that\u2019s weighing you down \u2014 and the urgency to <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/financial-health-debt\/\">get in control of your debt<\/a> and purge it from your life as soon as possible can make it hard to even know where to start the untangling process.<\/p>\n<p>And it makes sense that we feel this way. Our instinctive aversion to the very idea of debt is a result of having internalized the messages about it that we\u2019ve been passively absorbing since we were kids. Most of us are taught that debt is something to feel shame about, and so we do, despite how common it is. Even though we grow to <em>logically<\/em> know that debt isn\u2019t symptomatic of some moral failing, we still feel like it\u2019s a scarlet letter; a sign that we aren\u2019t yet our best selves. Debt happens, and it\u2019s not the end of the world, but that doesn\u2019t stop you from wanting it out of your life quickly.<\/p>\n<p>While that compulsion to get out of the red is entirely reasonable, the truth about what exactly you should do with your extra cash is a little more complicated. In certain situations, it\u2019s actually smarter to let your debt chill for the moment, opting instead to invest the extra cash.<\/p>\n<p>Enter Kara Brenholt, a chartered financial analyst (CFA) and one of Wealthfront\u2019s product managers, who sat with us to explain how to decide which option is your best bet to make your money do the absolute most for you right now.<\/p>\n<p>Since so few of us will ever find a literal sack of money on the sidewalk (unfair, frankly), here are a few steps you <em>can<\/em> take:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"#jump-one\">Make sure you have enough cash saved<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#jump-two\">Take down high-interest debts first<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"#jump-three\">Factor in the emotional burden<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>Tending To Your Financial Baseline<\/h2>\n<p id=\"jump-one\">First things first: Before figuring out where to put any extra money, you really have to make sure your basics are covered.<\/p>\n<p>Specifically, you should:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure you have enough cash saved<\/li>\n<li>Make at least the minimum payment on <em>all<\/em> your debts<\/li>\n<li>Take maximum advantage of <a href=\"https:\/\/401k.wealthfront.com\/how-does-401k-work\/\">your company\u2019s 401(k) match<\/a>, if available<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>\u201cIf you haven\u2019t met one of those requirements, focus on that before tackling anything else,\u201d says Kara. \u201cOnly once you\u2019ve met that baseline does the \u2018payoff debt versus investing\u2019 decision come into play.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Figuring out <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/build-emergency-fund\/\">how to build the right emergency fund<\/a> for you hinges on countless individual factors. Whatever your plan for building this reserve, make sure you\u2019re doing more than putting money into a yawn-worthy savings account \u2014 not all cash accounts are the low-interest bummer they used to be. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/cash\">Wealthfront\u2019s Cash Account, for example, carries a meaty interest rate of 2.24%<\/a>. This is over 23 times the interest on savings\/checking accounts offered at most traditional banks.<\/p>\n<p>Whatever a comfortable emergency cash stash means for you, if you don\u2019t have that, it\u2019s not a bad idea to put other concerns \u2014 like paying down debt and investing \u2014 on the back burner. Just for a bit! Think of it this way: If you don\u2019t have an emergency fund and suddenly lose your job, you could end up going into more debt. There are enough worries to steal your sleep \u2014 don\u2019t deny yourself the peace of mind of having a cash cushion before tackling anything else, just in case.<\/p>\n<h2>Kill Your Toxic Debt First<\/h2>\n<p id=\"jump-two\">Let\u2019s say you have some extra cash and are trying to decide whether to pay down your debt or invest it. Kara says you only need to know two numbers when making this call: <strong>your debt\u2019s after-tax interest rate<\/strong> and the <strong>rate of return on the investment<\/strong> you\u2019re considering. If the potential returns on your investment is higher than your debt\u2019s interest rate, you should prioritize investing.<\/p>\n<p>What does this decision look like in real life? It depends on what type of debt you have. Here are the average interest rates for the most common types of debt and investments:<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_10068\" style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-10068\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-10068\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/Q5_debt-01@2x-1-640x289.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"289\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/Q5_debt-01@2x-1-640x289.png 640w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/Q5_debt-01@2x-1-768x347.png 768w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/Q5_debt-01@2x-1-1173x530.png 1173w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/02\/Q5_debt-01@2x-1.png 1850w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-10068\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: Bankrate and Nerdwallet<\/p><\/div>\n<p><strong>Student Loans:<\/strong> The interest rate on your student loans could vary from 2% to more than 10% depending on what type of loan \u2014 federal or private \u2014 they are, whether they&#8217;re from undergrad or grad school, and what year you opened them. Like mortgage interest, <a href=\"https:\/\/turbotax.intuit.com\/tax-tips\/home-ownership\/about-tax-deductions-for-a-mortgage\/L2NEBzLjY\">student loan interest may be tax deductible<\/a> (up to a point). Before you calculate your after-tax interest rate, you first need to find out if you\u2019re eligible for the deduction. If your modified adjusted gross income is more than $80,000\/year as a single filer or more than $165,000\/year as a joint filer, you won\u2019t qualify to deduct your loan interest. If you make less than that, up to $2,500 of your interest could be tax deductible.<\/p>\n<p>Loans with a fixed interest rate lower than 6% may be worth keeping given their after-tax interest rate could be lower than the rate you could earn on a diversified portfolio. For someone who qualifies to deduct their interest and has a tax rate of 25%, the after-tax rate on a 6% student loan would be 4.5% (6% x (1 &#8211; 25%)). However, if you <em>don\u2019t<\/em> qualify for the tax deduction, you are likely wise to prioritize paying down your loans. Even if you don\u2019t decide to tackle paying down your loans, you may benefit from <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/financial-health-debt\/#refinance\">refinancing your student loans<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Using the aforementioned calculations, your after-tax interest rate on your loans might give you a clear answer as to whether or not you should prioritize paying off a loan versus putting that same money towards an investment. But if your after-tax interest rate on a loan is between 4% and 5% \u2014 in other words, slightly below the expected return on a diversified portfolio \u2014 then the choice between putting money towards debt versus feeding your investments can be less clear since the return from paying off your debt is guaranteed while the rate on your diversified portfolio is not. \u201cThis is something I constantly struggle with,\u201d says Kara, whose consolidated student debt has a 5.5% interest rate. \u201cI\u2019m always tempted to invest instead of paying extra on my loans.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Even if your expected return on the investment you\u2019re considering is much higher than your loan&#8217;s interest rate, market risks in the near-term make this impossible to guarantee. But the money you&#8217;ll save by putting the money toward your loan \u2014 thereby avoiding extra interest \u2014 is guaranteed.<\/p>\n<p>Kara\u2019s solution in situations like this is to split the cash in question between student loans, a Roth 401(k) for retirement, and a personal taxable account for flexible spending. \u201cThat way, I\u2019ve minimized my regret but also rationalized my decision,\u201d she explains.<\/p>\n<h2>Don\u2019t Discount Your Emotions<\/h2>\n<p id=\"jump-three\">While simply running the numbers is the most practical way to choose whether to pay off debt or invest, there\u2019s undoubtedly an emotional component to this decision.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSome people just want to prioritize being debt-free,\u201d says Kara. \u201cThey don\u2019t want the emotional burden.\u201d If your debt is affecting your overall peace of mind in a real way, then the subtleties of interest versus returns might not matter much.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re generally pretty risk-averse (no judgment; you\u2019ll outlive all of us) and even low-interest debt is keeping you up at night, you shouldn\u2019t feel obligated to weigh any factor in this decision more heavily than your own mental health \u2014 in a budgetary toss-up, no one can fault you for defaulting to a policy of prioritizing paying down your debt over making new investments.<\/p>\n<p>But if you\u2019re not unsettled by either option and are simply trying to come out ahead, run the numbers.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThink about what\u2019s going to put you in the best financial position,\u201d says Kara. \u201cWith low-interest debt, keeping it on the balance sheet \u2014 and investing the extra money \u2014 is sometimes smarter.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When you have some extra cash, how to do you decide whether to invest it or put it toward paying down debt?
