At one time, a survey of institutional investors in France found that 97% of their equity investments consisted of French companies despite the fact that France represented only 3% of the world\u2019s total equity capitalization. Such a bias is found all over the world. British investors prefer British companies, Japanese investors prefer Japanese companies, and U.S. investors prefer companies domiciled in the United States. Despite the substantial risk-reducing benefits of international diversification, investors all over the world exhibit a home country bias.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the risk-reducing benefits of broad diversification, investing outside one\u2019s home country is consistent with the basic rationale of index investing. In any national market, active portfolio management (involving the purchase of a subset of stocks believed to offer above-average returns) must be a zero-sum game. Since all the stocks in any market must be held by someone, the gains and losses from active management must balance out. If some investors are holding those stocks that produce above-average returns, it must follow that other investors must be holding the stocks that provide below-average returns. We can\u2019t all be above average.<\/p>\n<div class=\"pullquote-right\">\n<p class=\"pullquote\">Despite the substantial risk-reducing benefits of international diversification, investors all over the world exhibit a \u201cHome Country Bias.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>But, in fact, active investment management must be a negative-sum game. If active managers charge an expense ratio of, say, 1%, and if an index fund that buys and holds all the stocks in the market can be obtained at close to zero cost, then the typical active manager must <em>underperform<\/em> the index fund by the difference in expense ratios. And empirical data confirm that active managers as a group do <em>underperform<\/em> the market by the difference in the expenses they charge investors.<\/p>\n<p>The argument can be extended to world markets. If some active managers are holding only the stocks in national stock markets that outperform the world average, it must follow that other investors are holding stocks in the various country markets that have underperformed. The global index investor who holds a portfolio that consists of all the stocks in the world (by holding a world index fund or all the components of the world markets) must therefore outperform the average active manager who holds only a subset of the world\u2019s equity securities.<\/p>\n<p>Such a global portfolio would need to include <a href=\"http:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/e\/emergingmarketeconomy.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">emerging-market<\/a> (EM) equities as well as equities from developed markets. The\u00a0question then becomes how large a role should EMs play in your portfolio.<\/p>\n<h2>Emerging Markets Are Too Large to Be Ignored<\/h2>\n<p>If we are to come to some reasonable judgment regarding the appropriate exposure of an investment portfolio to emerging markets, it is important to understand their size and importance to the world economy. The table below presents the total market capitalization of the various regions of the world in millions of dollars. Note that the United States represents only 36.2% of the world\u2019s market capitalization. EMs represent 24.6%. Thus, if an investor wished to hold a world portfolio weighted by market capitalization, almost one quarter of that portfolio would consist of EM equities.<\/p>\n<h4>Figure 1, World Equity Market Capitalization, by region, March 2015*<\/h4>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Figure-1_final.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-5109\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Figure-1_final.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1_final\" width=\"580\" height=\"139\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Figure-1_final.jpg 1004w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Figure-1_final-640x154.jpg 640w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Figure-1_final-768x184.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h6>*Figures are not float adjusted and Korea is considered an emerging market consistent with MSCI indexes.

While growth has slowed in the developing world, the growth prospects for emerging-market economies remain substantially higher than those for the more mature economies. A major reason for the divergence is the substantial difference in the demography of the different regions of the world.<\/p>\n<h4>Figure 4, World Bank GDP Growth Forecasts, January 2015<\/h4>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Figure-4.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-5101\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Figure-4.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 4\" width=\"580\" height=\"145\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Figure-4.jpg 879w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Figure-4-640x160.jpg 640w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Figure-4-768x192.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h6>Source: Source: World Bank, Global Economic Prospects, January 2015<\/h6>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Populations are aging rapidly throughout the developed world.

Emerging markets represent about 25% of the world\u2019s equity market capitalization. Float-adjusted, these markets represent over 17% of the world total (float adjustment removes so called &#8216;control&#8217; holdings that do not trade in the market. For example, if a government holds 50% of a company\u2019s stock to maintain control of it, these shares will not trade freely and will not be available to investors).<\/p>\n<p>With respect to economic activity, a weight of about one-half would appear appropriate, where the economic outputs of various countries are adjusted for purchasing power parity. Emerging markets, with their younger populations, are forecast to grow more rapidly in the future, suggesting that the relative size of these markets will increase as well. Moreover, more firms are likely to be privatized as economic reforms are implemented in emerging-market countries. Thus, the EM share of global-world capitalization should grow as well.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the large size of emerging markets, investors in the United States allocate very small percentages of their equity portfolios to these markets. Individual investors hold less than 5% of their equity mutual funds in funds specializing in emerging markets. Institutional investors tend to hold more EM equities but the typical institutional allocation to EM is generally below 10%. The home country bias appears to be very strong. U.S. Investors tend to hold a far smaller share of EM equities than would be consistent with the size of these equity markets and with the share of world GDP represented by developing countries.<\/p>\n<h2>The CAPE Ratio Can Help<\/h2>\n<p>When considering the inclusion of an asset class in an investment portfolio, two other factors need to be considered. Risk and return are essential considerations in building optimal portfolios.<\/p>\n<p>Investing in emerging-market equities does involve additional risk. Equity markets in developing countries are extremely volatile. Moreover, some emerging markets have relatively unstable governments. Foreign investing for U.S. nationals also involves the assumption of currency risk (or the need to engage in potentially expensive <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Foreign_exchange_hedge\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">currency hedging<\/a>). Risk mitigation would indicate a smaller share of one\u2019s investment portfolio should be devoted to emerging markets than the previous discussion would suggest. Of course, portfolio considerations can cut the other way. As long as the correlations of the other asset classes with EM equities are moderate, adding volatile EM equities to a globally-diversified portfolio can, in some circumstances, actually decrease portfolio risk.<\/p>\n<p>Return considerations would justify that a significant share of an investment portfolio should be devoted to emerging markets. The United States equity markets have rallied sharply since the depth of the financial crisis in 2008 and present valuation levels suggest that future return will be far more modest.<\/p>\n<p>One of the best predictors of equity returns over the long run is the cyclically adjusted P\/E ratio or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/p\/pe10ratio.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CAPE ratio<\/a>. It measures the current price of a broad stock-market index divided by the average earnings of the component companies over the past 10 years. The CAPE ratio is not a reliable predictor of returns one or two years in the future, but it does provide a useful (though not perfect) forecast of returns 10 years in the future. Figure 6 presents the U.S. data starting in 1926. When stocks had CAPEs of 10\u00bd or less, the U.S. stock market produced 10-year returns of over 16%. But when CAPEs were over 25, returns tended to be far more modest, averaging under 4%.<\/p>\n<h4>Figure 6, Median 10-year Annual Compound Total Returns from Historic PE Deciles 1926 to Date<\/h4>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Figure-6.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-5110\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Figure-6.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 6\" width=\"580\" height=\"267\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Figure-6.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Figure-6-640x295.jpg 640w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Figure-6-768x354.jpg 768w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Figure-6-1151x530.jpg 1151w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h6>Source: The Leuthold Group<\/h6>\n<p>Unfortunately the CAPE ratio for the U.S. markets today is over 27 \u2014 an unusually high reading. Only in 1929, before the stock market crash and the Great Depression, and in early 2000, at the height of the Internet Bubble, was the CAPE at higher levels. Figure 7 presents a chart of the historical CAPE time series. To be sure, interest rates today are unusually low and that provides a justification for high asset prices. But the data also suggest that we should be projecting only modest future equity returns. (In the framework of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/c\/capm.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">capital asset pricing model<\/a>, the expected return for every level of risk is reduced when the &#8220;risk- free&#8221; rate is driven down to zero by the monetary authorities.)<\/p>\n<h4>Figure 7<\/h4>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Figure-7.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-5111\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Figure-7.png\" alt=\"Figure 7\" width=\"580\" height=\"433\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Figure-7.png 650w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Figure-7-640x478.png 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h6>Source: <a href=\"http:\/\/aida.econ.yale.edu\/~shiller\/data.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Online Data Robert Shiller<\/a><\/h6>\n<p>The CAPE is a useful indicator for future stock-market returns not only in the United States, but also in foreign developed and emerging markets in general.

The evidence does not support such a claim. Figure 10 shows conclusively that active management performs especially poorly in EMs. Few managers outperform and those that do in one period are usually not the same as those that outperform in the next period. The very inefficiency of the trading markets in these countries makes active trading from one security to another particularly unrewarding. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/b\/bid-askspread.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bid-ask spreads<\/a> tend to be high in EMs as are market-impact costs when blocks of securities are bought and sold. Moreover, a variety of trading costs such as \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/s\/stampduty.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">stamp taxes<\/a>\u201d makes trading extremely expensive.

While risky, these stock markets have relatively attractive valuations. At Wealthfront we have allocated between 5% and 28% of our portfolios to emerging market equities for investors who are able to tolerate some risk and who have long enough investment horizons to ride out the inevitable ups and downs of these markets. While our allocations tend to be higher than those recommended by many investment advisors, we believe that a home country bias has led to their underrepresentation in most globally diversified investment portfolios. And our allocations are far closer to the relative size of these markets in globally diversified capital markets. Certainly a market-capitalization weighted global portfolio would be a reasonable choice for an investor with average risk tolerance. Younger investors with long investment horizons and higher risk tolerances would find that portfolios farther out the return\/risk spectrum would be appropriate.<\/p>\n<hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\" \/>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; line-height: 12px;\"><strong>Disclosure<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; line-height: 12px;\">Nothing in this article should be construed as a solicitation or offer, or recommendation, to buy or sell any security.
