Now that a decade has passed, we wanted to check in to understand the impact the financial crisis had on our clients. We surveyed more than 1,000 clients<a href=\"#methodology\">*<\/a> and conducted a number of in-depth interviews to determine how millennials feel about their financial futures.<\/p>\n<p><strong>While more than one-third (36%) of clients claim the financial crisis changed their career path and slowed their professional growth, the majority (77%) believe their current career is setting them up for long-term success.<\/strong> This is counter to the often-recycled narrative that all millennials are living in their parents\u2019 basements or feeling stalled. Many, in fact, are thriving \u2014 though for some their path to success hasn\u2019t been the most conventional.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-9217 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Financial_Crisis_Survey_Career-compressor-640x336.jpg\" alt=\"Career Path Setting Millennials Up for Success\" width=\"640\" height=\"336\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Financial_Crisis_Survey_Career-compressor-640x336.jpg 640w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Financial_Crisis_Survey_Career-compressor-768x403.jpg 768w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Financial_Crisis_Survey_Career-compressor-1010x530.jpg 1010w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Financial_Crisis_Survey_Career-compressor-704x370.jpg 704w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Wealthfront client <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/surviving-the-crash-anna\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Anna Krishtal<\/a> is one of those people. Instead of getting a job after graduating in 2008, she earned a master\u2019s degree and traveled abroad, eventually blending her passions of education and travel to become an internship coordinator for international students.<\/p>\n<p>She says the market crashing pushed her to seek an alternate route. \u201cI actually don\u2019t think I\u2019d be where I am today were it not for the financial crisis,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t think that I would have believed that the life I\u2019m living now was possible.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Like Anna, many of our clients had to take alternate routes due to the recession, but most of them have one thing in common: rather than let the financial crisis derail their dreams, they actually became <em>more<\/em> ambitious and more future-oriented. They educated themselves and created solutions to their challenges. They redefined success \u2014 for them, it\u2019s less about being wealthy and more about achieving financial security so that they have the flexibility to pursue their passions. But they also understand there are no guarantees in life.<\/p>\n<p>When we zoomed out on the data about our millennial clients, here are some common themes we found:<\/p>\n<h2>They\u2019re realistic about the future<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Living through the financial crisis taught the vast majority of clients (71%) to pay more attention to their finances.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u201cI saw that nothing is guaranteed,\u201d explains Anna. \u201cSo as much as I love my job, love the work I do, and am grateful for the income and the lifestyle, I don\u2019t take any of it for granted.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It also taught our clients to be on the lookout for the next downturn: <strong>71% of clients worry we\u2019ll experience an economic recession within the next three years.<\/strong> The youngest subset of millennials (ages 18-24) is the least concerned, while the middle subset (ages 25-31) is the most concerned.<\/p>\n<p>Yet despite their concerns, nearly <strong>2 out of 3 say they\u2019re personally on track to meet their financial goals.\u00a0<\/strong>In fact, 3 out of 4 clients say they\u2019re still willing to take financial risks.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-9219\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Financial_Crisis_Survey_On_Track-compressor-640x336.jpg\" alt=\"2\/3 Wealthfront Clients Feel On Track\" width=\"640\" height=\"336\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Financial_Crisis_Survey_On_Track-compressor-640x336.jpg 640w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Financial_Crisis_Survey_On_Track-compressor-768x403.jpg 768w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Financial_Crisis_Survey_On_Track-compressor-1010x530.jpg 1010w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/09\/Financial_Crisis_Survey_On_Track-compressor-704x370.jpg 704w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>They\u2019re ready for anything<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Nearly all (81%) of those surveyed save money in an emergency fund, 71% don\u2019t spend above their means, and 52% wait longer to make big purchases.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Wealthfront client <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/surviving-the-crash-joyce-lee\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Joyce Lee<\/a> is a prime example.
