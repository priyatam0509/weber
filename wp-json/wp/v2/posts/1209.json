You can look to the professionals for some clues. Many are treating this shift as an opportunity to buy equities.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe believe this sell-off will provide opportunities to tweak our portfolio to buy more of good companies that have been oversold and sell good companies that have held up well.\u00a0 Since we are fully invested, we can\u2019t buy &#8216;more&#8217;, but we can upgrade the quality and characteristics of the portfolio at this time,\u201d says Glenn A. Dever, president of Berwyn, Pa.-based Coho Partners Ltd., which runs a strategy on Wealthfront\u2019s platform. \u201cWhat usually happens is that investors sell at the bottom and miss the bounce \u2013 whenever it happens.\u00a0 I\u2019d encourage comments to your investors to stick with their long-term strategy and not to panic.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Neither he nor other Wealthfront public equity money managers I spoke to today are making major shifts to their portfolios; they may be selling a few of their less promising holdings to buy shares in companies that suddenly look like bargains. The dive isn\u2019t a trigger to change asset allocations, except at the margins; rather, it\u2019s an opportunity to raise the quality of holdings within their equity allocations.

You\u2019re planning on buying a house, or you have a junior in high school.<\/p>\n<p>The hard advice from managers: Sell down to your budget, or sell down to the point that you can sleep at night.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis is my 26th year in the business. When people ask me about the next year or two, I say, \u2018Flip a coin,\u2019\u201d says David Rolfe, chief investment officer of St. Louis, Mo.-based Wedgewood Partners. \u201cThere\u2019s just an unknowable set of circumstances.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>While managers are hopeful the market will bounce back on good economic news or a sign in November that politicians are grappling realistically with the entitlement problem, when (when?!) the bounce will happen is anybody\u2019s guess.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAfter Lehman, it took people a couple of quarters of earnings statements to realize that these companies weren\u2019t going to go away,\u201d says Gregg Giboney, president and portfolio manager for Timberline Investment Management, a West Linn, Ore.-based firm that runs a strategy on Wealthfront\u2019s platform. \u201cAt this point, the markets are focused more on the emotional [factors] than the fundamentals.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>For those who like to laugh when they cry<\/h3>\n<p>Then again, there are those who don\u2019t seem to have as much faith in the markets, like comedian Andy Borowitz. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.borowitzreport.com\/\">\u201cIn an effort to find a safe haven, rattled investors fled the dollar today and moved their money into Groupons.\u201d<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When the market takes a sharp dive, two groups of people worry: those who ought to, and those who shouldn\u2019t.
