You know exactly which credit card to use for each purchase in order to get the most points. You read a few Yelp reviews before deciding where you\u2019ll have dinner (or these days, order takeout). And you probably spend a lot of time and effort checking the balance in your various financial accounts and moving money around to make sure it\u2019s all in the right place. You make sure you have enough in checking to pay your bills, but you\u2019re also careful not to hold too much in cash lest you miss out on returns. You know it\u2019s important to save and invest for your future, but managing it all isn\u2019t easy. In fact, it\u2019s such a hassle that you might not monitor your accounts as closely as you should.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Now, you can let Autopilot do it. Autopilot is Wealthfront\u2019s free service that automates your savings strategy \u2013 you can think of it as your financial assistant.<\/strong> Say goodbye to monitoring multiple accounts and setting up numerous transfers. Just tell Autopilot how much to keep in cash and it\u2019ll automatically save or invest the rest. You\u2019ll stay in full control of your finances and enjoy peace of mind knowing your money is exactly where you want it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How does it work?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Like a meticulous assistant, Autopilot takes care of the details so you can focus on the big picture. If you already have a Wealthfront Account, you\u2019ll be prompted to set up Autopilot when you open the app. Getting started is easy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Choose an account to monitor \u2014&nbsp;a checking account or your Wealthfront Cash Account.&nbsp;<\/li><li>Set a maximum balance for that account. Choose a balance that\u2019s more than the amount you spend or withdraw each month.<\/li><li>When Autopilot detects that you\u2019re over your maximum by at least $100, it will schedule a transfer of your excess cash to your Wealthfront account of choice \u2013 a Cash Account or Investment Account. You\u2019re the ultimate decision-maker, and you always have 24 hours to cancel the transfer before it happens.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1312\" height=\"530\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/9.2-autopilot-blogpost-2-1312x530.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13436\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/9.2-autopilot-blogpost-2-1312x530.png 1312w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/9.2-autopilot-blogpost-2-640x258.png 640w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/9.2-autopilot-blogpost-2-768x310.png 768w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/9.2-autopilot-blogpost-2-1536x620.png 1536w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/9.2-autopilot-blogpost-2-2048x827.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1312px) 100vw, 1312px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>About to pay a big bill or withdraw from your account? No problem. If your account balance decreases before the transfer, Autopilot is smart enough to maintain the cash you need and only transfer the excess so you don\u2019t have to worry about overdrafting. You\u2019re always in complete control, and you can turn Autopilot off at any time. And soon, Autopilot will be able to monitor multiple accounts and transfer funds to multiple destination accounts.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Let Autopilot do it<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you use Autopilot, you can enjoy the peace of mind that comes from knowing your money will be put to work automatically. At the same time, you can feel confident that you\u2019re holding enough cash to meet your monthly needs.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Autopilot is more intelligent than recurring transfers because it adjusts the size and timing of your transfers to reflect changes in your account balance over time. But you can also use Autopilot in tandem with recurring transfers to make sure any excess cash gets put to work, too. It\u2019s tedious to constantly monitor your accounts to make sure you\u2019re holding exactly the right amount of cash \u2013 and you have better things to do. Let Autopilot take care of it for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A major step towards Self-Driving Money\u2122<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At Wealthfront, we want to optimize your money across spending, savings, and investments and put it all to work effortlessly.
