This past year Wealthfront lowered the minimum account balance required to take advantage of Stock-level Tax-Loss Harvesting to $100,000. \u00a0In addition, we began to offer tax-loss harvesting to all our clients, regardless of their account balance.\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fortunately, these moves came before the increased volatility we saw in global markets in the second half of the year, which meant many more opportunities to harvest losses for our clients. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>Of course, you can only claim the benefit of these losses if you file them correctly on your tax return, and for some people, entering investment transactions on their tax forms can seem daunting and time consuming.<\/p>\n<p>This year, we&#8217;re proud to announce that we have <strong>deepened our integration with TurboTax<\/strong> to automatically import and roll up all your Tax-Loss Harvesting and Stock-level Tax-Loss Harvesting transactions into a simple set of entries for easy tax filing. \u00a0If you choose to use TurboTax for your filing needs, all you need to do is enter your Wealthfront credentials directly, and TurboTax will automatically download the relevant data from your Wealthfront accounts. The downloaded transactions will further be summarized to ensure that they are easy to deal with and easy to file. (For the tax geeks among us, these transactions are summarized according to\u00a0<u>Exception 1 &amp; 2 in the IRS\u2019s instructions for Form 8949)<\/u><\/p>\n<p>Now that filing for these transactions is completely automatic and simple, there really is no reason anyone should hesitate to turn Tax-Loss Harvesting on in their Wealthfront account. Don&#8217;t miss out on another year of benefits these services can bring.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/WF-Turbotax-final.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" size-full wp-image-5443 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/WF-Turbotax-final.jpg\" alt=\"WF-Turbotax-final\" width=\"570\" height=\"514\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/WF-Turbotax-final.jpg 570w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/WF-Turbotax-final-554x500.jpg 554w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 570px) 100vw, 570px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>For clients who choose to use another software package or an accountant, <strong>a simple downloadable spreadsheet export<\/strong> of all relevant transactions will also be made available.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Make Sure You&#8217;re Prepared for April 18th\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve also redesigned the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/dashboard\/documents\">Taxes &amp; Documents<\/a> section of your web dashboard to improve and simplify access to all of your necessary documents and transactions.

Adding to the complexity, it is not unusual for ETF issuers to revise their tax filings after the initial date. As a result, it is usually prudent to wait until the end of February for revisions before filing one\u2019s taxes. All Wealthfront clients will receive a detailed email outlining the availability of their relevant tax forms when their tax documents are ready.<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Make Sure You Are Set Up for 2016<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>At Wealthfront, we pride ourselves on being the most tax-efficient automated investment service.
