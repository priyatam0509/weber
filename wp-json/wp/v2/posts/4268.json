First, we\u2019re now into the fourth decade of evangelism for <strong>passive, index-based investing<\/strong>. More and more people have come to believe that attempting to beat the market is a fool\u2019s errand, and that the right approach to long term investing is to instead focus on diversification, expenses &amp; taxes. Second, the <strong>massive millennial generation\u2014<\/strong>\u00a0larger than even the baby boomers born between 1981 and 2000\u2014 has now been entering the workforce for more than a decade. Despite economic challenges, millions of millennials are starting to find significant success in their careers, and having grown up with computers, they have an inherent confidence in the things that software can do better than people.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While Wealthfront clients vary in age between 19 and 93, over 55% of our clients are under 35. Over 85% are below 50. Wealthfront fills the need for a simple, transparent and inexpensive solution for long-term investors to accumulate wealth.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When you provide a valuable service that people love, they tell their friends about it. And Wealthfront clients continue to do so, in ever increasing numbers.<\/p>\n<h2>The Amazing Breadth of Wealthfront Clients<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To better understand who is using Wealthfront, we pulled a wide range of client statistics.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Geography<\/strong>. When I first asked to see how many states Wealthfront had clients in, I was a bit surprised to get back the number 53. It turns out that not only does Wealthfront have clients in all 50 states, we also have clients in Washington D.C. and two active-duty military postal codes (AE &amp; AP).\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>Client Assets<\/strong>. While the average Wealthfront client trusted us with over $91,000 (as of Dec 2013), the range covers more than three orders of magnitude. Our minimum continues to be $5,000 but our largest accounts stretch to well above $5 million.\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>Liquid Net Worth<\/strong>. Here again, there is an amazing range. \u00a0Not surprisingly, because Wealthfront is absolutely free for accounts under $10,000, 20% of Wealthfront clients have a liquid net worth of less than $50,000. At the same time, the unique features and value Wealthfront offers seems to draw in very successful individuals as well. Over 16% of our clients have liquid net worths in excess of $1 million.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Companies<\/strong>. Wealthfront has clearly also become a favorite in the high tech community. The ten technology companies with the most Wealthfront clients as employees are:\n<p>1. Google<br \/>\n2. Facebook<br \/>\n3. LinkedIn<br \/>\n4. Microsoft<br \/>\n5. Twitter<br \/>\n6. Palantir<br \/>\n7. VMware<br \/>\n8. Apple<br \/>\n9. Intuit<br \/>\n10. Cisco<\/p>\n<p>(If your company is not on the list, we\u2019re highly supportive of efforts to get them there. Let us know if you\u2019d like us to visit and \u00a0give one of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/seminars\" target=\"_blank\">our successful talks<\/a> at your company.)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><strong>Careers<\/strong>. While Wealthfront clearly has a strong appeal with engineers and product managers who work in high tech, the breadth of our clients\u2019 professions is staggering. X-Ray technicians, U.S. Marines, consultants, teachers, professors, students, journalists, speech pathologists, priests, pilots, physicians, investment bankers and lawyers have all trusted Wealthfront with their long-term investments.\n<\/li>\n<li><strong>Velocity<\/strong>. \u00a0It took Wealthfront almost a year to reach $67M in assets under management. Fast forward to last month: Wealthfront added over $67M in assets in December 2013 alone.\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/500MM-infographic-v8.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Check out this infographic<\/a> to learn more about the amazing group of clients that trust Wealthfront as their financial advisor.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/500MM-infographic-v8.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4272 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/01\/infographicwordpress.png\" alt=\"infographicwordpress\" width=\"262\" height=\"424\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>Dreaming Big<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Decades ago, Charles Schwab had the audacity to give young Baby Boomers the ability to place trades directly.
