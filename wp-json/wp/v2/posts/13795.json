Dealing with your taxes doesn\u2019t have to be daunting. Here are eight ways you can get ready to file your 2020 tax return, whether you\u2019re working with an accountant or tax preparation software like TurboTax.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>1. Mark your calendar<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Highlight April 15 on your calendar before you do anything else. This is the date by which you must either file your taxes or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/pub\/irs-pdf\/f4868.pdf\">Form 4686<\/a> to get a tax extension. It\u2019s also the deadline to contribute to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) for 2020 if you haven\u2019t already maxed yours out. You don\u2019t need to wait until April 15 to submit your tax return &nbsp;\u2014 you can do so as soon as you have all the necessary documents.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. Gather your documents<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting in January, you should receive tax paperwork from your employer and your banks. The documents you\u2019ll need to file your taxes will vary depending on your situation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some of the forms you might need:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>W-2 from your employer<\/li><li>Schedule K-1 for income received from an estate, trust, partnership, or S-corporation<\/li><li>1095-A for health insurance through the Health Insurance Marketplace<\/li><li>5498 for contributions made to IRAs<\/li><li>1098 for mortgage interest<\/li><li>1098-E for student loan interest<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You may also need various kinds of 1099s, including:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>1099-NEC (formerly 1099-MISC) for income from contract work over $600<\/li><li>1099-DIV for earnings from stocks and mutual funds<\/li><li>1099-INT for interest from bank accounts, CDs, and other accounts<\/li><li>1099-B for income from selling stocks, bonds, or mutual funds<\/li><li>1099-R for distributions from retirement accounts or pensions<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Other employer provided forms might include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>3921 for exercise of incentive stock options<\/li><li>3922 for acquisitions or purchases through an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Wealthfront clients can download their tax documents (1099-R for IRA withdrawals and consolidated 1099s for taxable accounts) directly from their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/dashboard\/documents\">dashboard<\/a> by clicking on the menu item labeled \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/documents\">Documents<\/a>.\u201d These forms will become available in February, but you may receive additional <a href=\"https:\/\/support.wealthfront.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/211006043-Why-did-I-receive-a-corrected-Form-1099-or-other-tax-document-\">correction documents<\/a> going into March.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>3. Review your year<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Was 2020 a big year for you? If so, those life events may come with some tax breaks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you got married:<\/strong> It\u2019s time to decide if you\u2019ll <a href=\"https:\/\/turbotax.intuit.com\/tax-tips\/marriage\/should-you-and-your-spouse-file-taxes-jointly-or-separately\/L7gyjnqyM\">file your taxes separately or jointly<\/a>. For most people, it makes sense to file your taxes jointly. <a href=\"https:\/\/turbotax.intuit.com\/tax-tips\/marriage\/when-married-filing-separately-will-save-you-taxes\/L7FD32bvj\">This article<\/a> can show you exactly how to decide. For example, if you or your spouse has an income-based student loan, filing separately could keep your payments from dramatically increasing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you purchased a home: <\/strong>You may be able to deduct your mortgage interest (on mortgages up to $750,000) and property taxes (part of your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.taxslayer.com\/tax-reform\/state-and-local\">SALT burden<\/a>; limited to $10,000 a year).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you had a baby: <\/strong>You\u2019ll likely get a $2,000 tax credit that\u2019s even <a href=\"https:\/\/www.taxpolicycenter.org\/briefing-book\/what-difference-between-refundable-and-nonrefundable-credits\">refundable<\/a> up to $1,400, although this credit starts phasing out if you are married, file jointly, and your income is above $400,000. You may also be eligible for tax credits for child care. Remember to fill out a new W-4 with your employer, as you\u2019ll now have an additional withholding allowance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>4. Decide if you\u2019ll itemize<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to tax deductions, you have two options:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Claim the standard deduction. This allows you to deduct $12,400 (for single filers) or $24,800 (for joint filers) from your taxable income this year.<\/li><li>Itemize your deductions instead.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>To decide if you want to itemize, add up your various deductible expenses such as:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Medical bills<\/li><li>Charitable contributions<\/li><li>State and local taxes<\/li><li>Property taxes<\/li><li>Investment interest expenses<\/li><li>Mortgage interest payments<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If the total reaches more than $12,400 (for single filers) or $24,800 (for joint filers), you\u2019ll want to itemize and need to file a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/pub\/irs-pdf\/f1040sa.pdf\">Schedule A (Form 1040)<\/a>. If you choose not to itemize, you\u2019ll file a return claiming the standard deduction and Schedule A won\u2019t be included. If your spouse itemizes, then you\u2019ll need to do so as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of whether you take the standard deduction or itemize, you can take what are called \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/articles\/tax\/11\/above-the-line-deductions.asp\">above-the-line<\/a>\u201d deductions which will further reduce your taxable income.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Above-the-line deductions include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Student loan interest payments<\/li><li>Unreimbursed moving expenses for a job<\/li><li>Health savings account (HSA) contributions<\/li><li>401(k) contributions<\/li><li>SEP-IRA contributions<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which was signed in March 2020, allows for a $300 above-the-line charitable deduction. The deductions under the CARES Act must be in cash (checks and credit card payments qualify but securities and household items do not), and given to a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/1\/501c3-organizations.asp\">501(c)(3)<\/a> public charity directly.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5. Contribute to your IRA<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Individual Retirement Accounts (or IRAs) are a <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/3-benefits-of-iras-and-1-drawback-what-you-need-to-know\/\">great type of account to consider<\/a> as you save for retirement. If you\u2019re planning to contribute to an IRA for the 2020 tax year, April 15 is the deadline to do so. The annual contribution limit is $6,000 ($7,000 if you are 50 or older).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re interested in funding an IRA but you\u2019re not sure which kind to use, check out Wealthfront\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/ira-calculator\">IRA Account Selection Tool<\/a> to learn more about your IRA eligibility. Wealthfront offers traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs, and SEP IRAs, as well as <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wealthfront-now-offers-easy-roth-conversions\/\">easy Roth conversions<\/a>. You can transfer funds directly from your Cash Account to your Wealthfront IRA.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>6. Use your harvested losses<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>2020 was a volatile year for financial markets. If you were a Wealthfront client, you likely received enough benefit from our Tax-Loss Harvesting service to <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/how-wealthfronts-tlh-pays-for-itself\/\">cover our annual 0.25% advisory fee several times over<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tax-loss harvesting involves selling investments that have declined in value, generating a loss you can use to lower your taxes. If you have a Wealthfront Investment Account, we automatically harvest your losses for you.&nbsp; If you use TurboTax, you can automatically import your tax-loss harvesting information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>7. Consider working with a professional<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If this sounds complicated, especially if you sold employee stock options this past year, it\u2019s a good time to ask yourself if you should hire an accountant. Typically, this is a good move if your taxes are complex \u2013\u2013 say, you own a business, you\u2019re subject to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/a\/alternativeminimumtax.asp\">Alternative Minimum Tax<\/a> (AMT), or you receive <a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/s\/schedule-k-1.asp\">K-1s<\/a>. For more information about who should consider hiring an accountant, <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/9-instances-in-which-to-hire-a-tax-accountant\/\">check out our blog post<\/a>. If you do decide to hire an accountant, here are <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/how-to-choose-a-tax-accountant\/\">11 questions to ask first<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you plan to file your own tax return, there are a number of tax preparation programs to choose from including TurboTax, Credit Karma Tax, TaxAct, and TaxSlayer. Wealthfront clients who use <a href=\"https:\/\/turbotax.com\/affiliate\/wealth\">TurboTax will get $15 off a Premier and $20 off a Self-Employed filing<\/a>.

Determine how you\u2019ll pay<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on your tax withholdings and the estimated taxes you\u2019ve paid on any income not subject to withholding, you could either receive a refund from the IRS or owe money on your 2020 taxes.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you think you might owe money, now is a good time to plan for how you\u2019ll pay. You can use your <a href=\"https:\/\/support.wealthfront.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/360044303891-Routing-and-account-numbers-for-Cash-Accounts\">account and routing numbers<\/a> to pay your tax bill (up to the ACH limit of $25,000) directly from your Wealthfront Cash Account if you have checking features activated.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have enough cash on hand, you\u2019re all set. But if you need to bridge the gap between paychecks and have a Wealthfront Investment Account balance of at least $25,000, you can use our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/portfolio-line-of-credit\">Portfolio Line of Credit <\/a>&nbsp;to get cash as soon as the next day. Your Wealthfront Portfolio Line of Credit is secured by your investment portfolio and allows you to immediately access a low-interest loan without disrupting your investment strategy, making it a <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/why-you-should-consider-a-portfolio-line-of-credit-at-tax-time\/\">good option to consider at tax time<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tax time rolls around every year, and many people dread it. But if you\u2019re prepared with your paperwork and have a plan, there\u2019s nothing to fear. We hope these eight steps will help set you up for a less stressful tax season.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Editor&#8217;s note: On March 17, 2021 the IRS extended the federal filing and payment deadline for the 2020 tax year from April 15 to May 17.\u00a0 You can read more about it here.
