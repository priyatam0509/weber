Being properly diversified also enables rebalancing and tax-loss harvesting, both of which can help you during market corrections. <strong>Unfortunately, investors often think they have a diversified portfolio when, actually, they don\u2019t.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the common questions we get from investors who don\u2019t use Wealthfront is: \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I just invest in the S&amp;P 500?\u201d They seem to believe that investing in an index that gives them exposure to a broad selection of securities means they have a diversified portfolio. Having a broad selection of securities is a good start. But it\u2019s only one of the three dimensions of diversification.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In <em>The Elements of Investing<\/em>, Burton Malkiel (our Chief Investment Officer) and Charley Ellis (noted investor, author, and member of our investment advisory board) outline the three dimensions of diversification you need to improve your chances of long-term investing success.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The three ways to diversify are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Across assets<\/li><li>Across asset classes<\/li><li>Across time<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Here, we\u2019ll take a closer look at what these three kinds of diversification are and why they\u2019re important.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1. Diversification across assets<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Diversifying across assets means investing in the stocks or bonds of many companies and issuers, not just a few. Doubling down on your company stock is a glaring example of <em>not<\/em> diversifying across assets. Even if you work for Apple, Google, or Facebook, owning too much of your own company stock has the potential to create serious financial problems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In their book, Burton and Charley describe an Enron employee who invested her entire retirement savings in Enron stock through the company\u2019s 401(k) plan, only to see her savings decimated when Enron unraveled.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is an extreme example. The general point is that individual stock ownership represents <a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/u\/unsystematicrisk.asp\">diversifiable risk<\/a> (in contrast to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/s\/systemic-risk.asp\">market or systemic risk<\/a>). Diversifiable risk, by definition, is risk that can be mitigated by spreading your portfolio across a broad set of investments. To be diversified across assets, don\u2019t invest a lot of your portfolio in any single stock, and don\u2019t allow your company stock to dominate your portfolio after it has become vested and liquid.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, invest your money in broadly diversified index funds. For your U.S.equity exposure, we recommend you invest in broadly diversified, low-cost ETFs like <a href=\"https:\/\/investor.vanguard.com\/etf\/profile\/VTI\">VTI<\/a>, which gives you exposure to over 3,000 U.S. stocks (including Apple, Google, and Facebook) for the measly cost of 0.03% annually (which means you pay $3 annually for every $10,000 you invest).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. Diversification across asset classes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another important way to diversify is across asset classes, or capital markets. You can improve your risk-adjusted returns by investing in less correlated assets, because it is virtually impossible to predict which asset class is going to outperform the others in any given year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyone who tells you they can predict the performance of different asset classes with any reasonable consistency is either fooling herself or trying to fool you. Jack Bogle, the founder of the Vanguard Group, has a great saying about trying to time the market: \u201cAfter nearly 50 years in this business, I do not know of anyone who has done it successfully and consistently. I don\u2019t even know anybody who knows anybody who has done it successfully and consistently.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To illustrate this point, we put together the table below. It displays the ranking of asset class returns by year for the past 10 years. The key takeaway is that no asset class consistently wins or loses. In fact, there\u2019s a different winner nearly every year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"665\" height=\"530\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/100220-diviersificationtable-1-665x530.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13543\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/100220-diviersificationtable-1-665x530.png 665w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/100220-diviersificationtable-1-627x500.png 627w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/100220-diviersificationtable-1-768x612.png 768w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/100220-diviersificationtable-1-1536x1224.png 1536w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/10\/100220-diviersificationtable-1-2048x1632.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 665px) 100vw, 665px\" \/><figcaption>Source: Wealthfront<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You might be surprised to learn that U.S. stocks have only been the top-performing asset class in 2 out of the last 10 years (2013 and 2019). And in 2011, they were one of the worst-performing asset classes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A portfolio diversified across asset classes will also tend to give you higher returns, and it\u2019s easy to see why. If you invested only in an S&amp;P 500 index fund, you would miss out on the winning years of the other asset classes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>3. Diversification across time<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The final dimension of diversification is time. It\u2019s better to invest as early in your career as you can to give your returns more time to compound. There is nothing so magical in investing as generating returns on top of prior returns and repeating this over and over again. Albert Einstein reportedly said: \u201cCompound interest is the eighth wonder of the world.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an ideal world, you would invest a large sum as early as possible. Unfortunately, this isn\u2019t consistent with how most people earn (i.e. salary, vested company stock, bonuses) and you may need to work through some decisions (like buying a home or paying off student loans) before investing a large sum anyway. Moreover, investing all at once can make you sensitive to the timing of your investments if the markets correct soon thereafter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, too many investors suffer from decision paralysis: they are so afraid of picking the \u201cwrong day\u201d to invest, they end up not investing their savings at all. As a result, they miss out on valuable time in the market when their savings could have been compounding.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/dollar-cost-averaging-behavioral-view\/\">Dollar-cost averaging<\/a> is the most popular way to diversify across time and avoid this issue. Rather than picking the \u201cright day\u201d to invest, dollar-cost averaging is a process where investors break up a lump sum into several smaller amounts, and then invest a portion consistently on a set schedule. For example, an investor with a $20,000 bonus might invest $4,000 per month for five months.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also diversify across time by using Wealthfront\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/meet-autopilot-a-new-service-that-automates-your-savings-strategy\/\">free service Autopilot<\/a>, which will continuously monitor a checking account or your Cash Account for excess cash to invest. Whenever Autopilot spots at least $100 of excess cash in the monitored account, it will schedule a transfer to your Investment Account. This means you don\u2019t have to think about when to invest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Don\u2019t just invest in the S&amp;P 500<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It may be tempting to just invest in the S&amp;P 500, especially in a year when U.S. stocks are significantly up. But if you do this, you\u2019ll be missing out on an opportunity to diversify your portfolio and your long-term returns may suffer as a result. If you diversify across all three dimensions recommended in this post, you can increase your risk-adjusted returns over the long run. And, in a volatile market, you will sleep better at night knowing you\u2019ve protected your portfolio across all three dimensions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Diversification matters.
