A year ago, 60% of our clients were under age 35. Lately, the rate at which we attract young investors has increased dramatically, which has increased the frequency of requests for a lower minimum.<\/p>\n<p>At first, we were surprised to see this surge in demand for a lower minimum. \u00a0After all, there are a number of investment services from startups that have lower minimums. However, as we evaluated these services, we noticed that they have fallen prey to the <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@adamnash\/it-s-time-to-kill-the-monthly-fee-for-small-accounts-51d37177bfe7\">excessive monthly fees<\/a>\u00a0 that plague the traditional investment industry.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">At Wealthfront, we believe everyone deserves sophisticated financial advice \u2013 regardless of your account size or your net worth. So we were disappointed that other services were taking advantage of younger investors \u2014 many of whom were just starting out with their first investment account.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Today, that changes.<\/p>\n<p>Now anyone can get a low-cost diversified portfolio whether she has $500 or $5,000. More importantly, we\u2019re a great place to begin building your nest egg because we only charge a low 0.25% annual advisory fee. You no longer have to worry about how much of your hard earned money is being taken in fees.<\/p>\n<p><b>An Optimal Portfolio at Any Size<\/b><\/p>\n<p>In order to lower the minimum to $500, we borrowed some of the innovative technology we pioneered with our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/tax-optimized-direct-indexing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stock-level Tax-Loss Harvesting platform<\/a>.\u00a0Our state of the art portfolio optimizer, designed by our <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wealthfront-hire-world-class-research-team\/\">deeply experienced investment research team<\/a>, chooses the ideal combination of ETFs for your portfolio based on the size of your account and risk score. We do this while minimizing your cash balance and keeping you fully invested regardless of moves in market prices.<\/p>\n<p>The result is an optimal portfolio for any account level composed of Wealthfront-selected ETF investments. Although $500 can&#8217;t even purchase one share of Google (Ticker: GOOGL), now with just $500 you can get exposure to a globally diversified portfolio across multiple asset classes representing thousands of securities, all in a simple, convenient and automated Wealthfront account.<\/p>\n<p><b>Leading the Next Generation of Investors<\/b><\/p>\n<p>At Wealthfront, we\u2019re proud that <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/software-based-companies-judged-rate-innovation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the features we bring to market have come to define our category<\/a>.
