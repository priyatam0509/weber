(Registration required).<\/p>\n<p>ETFs began as funds (they are technically a kind of mutual fund) that track indexes. Those index-tracking funds are often very inexpensive, and can provide the core holdings of a portfolio. The fact that ETFs can be traded throughout the day is not of concern to investors with long-term strategies.<\/p>\n<p>As ETFs became more popular, the financial services industry began introducing more complicated funds. Now, you can find ETFs that track, say, alternative investment strategies and that use derivatives and debt to multiply their returns.<\/p>\n<p>The North American State Securities Administrators issued an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.state.tn.us\/commerce\/securities\/documents\/NASAA_Advisory_ETFs_TN.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">advisory<\/a> not long ago in which they warned investors about <em>exotic<\/em> ETFs and identified the common, traditional ones:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Index \u2013<\/strong> Seeks to mirror the performance of a specific investment index, such as the S&amp;P 500\u00ae or the Dow Jones Industrial Average.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Commodity \u2013<\/strong> Seeks to mirror the performance of a specific commodity or commodity group, such as gold or oil.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bond \u2013 <\/strong>Seeks to mirror the performance of a specific bond index or product, such as U.S. Treasury or municipal bonds.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Currency \u2013<\/strong> Seeks to mirror the performance of a specific currency or basket of U.S. or international currencies, such as the Euro or Yen.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Industry \u2013 <\/strong>Seeks to mirror the performance of a specific industry segment, such as healthcare or manufacturing.<\/p>\n<p>Practically speaking, you can be reasonably sure you\u2019re looking at a plain vanilla ETF if it tracks an underlying index that you\u2019ve heard of. Another sign that you\u2019re dealing with a plain vanilla ETF is that its tracking error is low.
