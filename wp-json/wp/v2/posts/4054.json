We believe these are the companies that will generate the greatest career opportunities and the most significant potential for equity wealth in the near future.<\/p>\n<p>Specifically we sought out private companies we think are on a rapid growth trajectory and that are likely to continue that growth for at least a few years and that have revenues of at least $20 million but no more than $300 million.<\/p>\n<p>The list includes some very familiar and well-covered names including DropBox, Box, and AirBnb but it likely includes at least 10 companies that you\u2019ve never heard of. Among these are Aerohive Networks, MapR Technologies, CipherCloud, Delphix, Nutanix, Acronis, Plex Systems, Qualtrics, Datastax, and Sencha.<\/p>\n<p>Within the list you will find a brief description of the company&#8217;s mission and its location as well as a link to the website of each, all conveniently aggregated in one spot.<\/p>\n<p>An interesting facet of the trend this year is that 60% of the companies on the list are building enterprise &#8212; rather than consumer products. There are even five companies dedicated to building payments products including Boku, Square, Braintree, Stripe, and Trialpay.<\/p>\n<p>As you might expect many of the companies are located in Silicon Valley and the San Francisco Bay Area but other technology hubs are represented including New York, Boston, and Los Angeles.<\/p>\n<p>In his various roles, first as co-founder of Benchmark Capital, through his current work as both a lecturer at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and now as the CEO of Wealthfront, Andy has witnessed and lived through a lot of what makes the tech community tick.<\/p>\n<p>Andy has already shared a lot of detailed career advice in a series of Wealthfront blog posts but we thought it would be a good idea to consolidate that content into a single, more concise guide &#8212; fully updated for 2013.<\/p>\n<p>We believe that Andy\u2019s 30+ years of experience &#8212; all of it spent working with entrepreneurs and technology companies &#8212; adds up to plenty of valuable and actionable career advice.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Editor&#8217;s note: To see this year&#8217;s updated list, visit\u00a0The 2021 Wealthfront Career-Launching Companies List.
