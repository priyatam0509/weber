This summer, we <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/the-wealthfront-cash-account-now-comes-with-checking-features\/\">enabled checking features<\/a> so you can direct deposit your paycheck (and get paid up to two days early), pay bills and friends, make purchases with a debit card, and access your cash via a network of free ATMs. Next, we made it possible to <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/you-can-now-deposit-a-check-with-the-wealthfront-app\/\">deposit a check<\/a> right from the mobile app. Still, our clients told us that they occasionally needed to send paper checks, as annoyingly antiquated as they are. <strong>That\u2019s why we\u2019re glad to announce you can now easily send a check <strong>\u2014<\/strong> on a one-time or recurring basis <strong>\u2014<\/strong> right from the Wealthfront app.<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ve made sending a check simple, so it takes just a few taps on your phone.
