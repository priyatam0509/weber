To help get you started, we\u2019ve put together a checklist of important financial tasks you should consider before the clock strikes midnight on New Year\u2019s Eve.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The basics<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Review your spending and set up automated savings: <\/strong>Automate your savings to your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/investing\">Investment Account<\/a> so you don\u2019t have to think about it.
