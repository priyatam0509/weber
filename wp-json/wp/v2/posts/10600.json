Since we launched the cash account in February,<strong> our clients have earned over $10 million in interest, <\/strong>more than 23 times as much as their money would have earned in a traditional savings account*. We believe your money should be making money for <em>you<\/em>, not your bank. You\u2019ll see that in everything we do. We\u2019re creating expanded features \u2014 starting with our cash account \u2014 that you won\u2019t just tolerate out of necessity but that you\u2019ll genuinely love.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today\u2019s new interest rate <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/the-wealthfront-cash-account-now-has-a-2-29-apy\/\">marks the third increase<\/a> since we first launched our Wealthfront Cash Account in February.

We are relentless in the pursuit of reducing costs so we can pass along more savings to you. Our goal is to build financial products and experiences for our clients that are stripped of the costly excesses of the established financial system. We have a single-minded obsession with understanding exactly what financial services and products you want and how you want to use them. (No, we don\u2019t have hobbies. This is what we live for.) All the stuff you <em>don\u2019t <\/em>want \u2014 long lines at bank branches, various accounts at different institutions with no easy way to move money between them \u2014 we\u2019re just not doing any of it. The money we save by not doing it? That\u2019s yours.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If it feels surprising that we keep delivering on our promise to make your money work for you, that\u2019s because your old bank just won\u2019t do this. In the last quarter of 2018 alone, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-usa-banks-results\/u-s-banks-record-59-1-billion-in-profits-in-fourth-quarter-of-2018-idUSKCN1QA2LK\">U.S. banks made over $59 billion in profits<\/a> while your cash sat around in their accounts earning you next to nothing. In traditional banks, your money cushions <em>their <\/em>bottom line, while we work tirelessly trying to make your money earn more for <em>you<\/em>. Because it\u2019s your money. Quite simply, that means something to us. In fact, it means everything to us.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The way we see it, traditional banks are not built to be the client-driven financial ecosystem Wealthfront is building. To us, banks seem to be either fundamentally incapable or ideologically unwilling to centralize customers\u2019 interests. Basically, technology has evolved to where banks as we know them are weighed down with tremendous, unnecessary operational costs \u2014 and guess who pays for that? Wealthfront is building what comes next. As long as your money is with your old bank, it\u2019s making money for them, not you. Why should your deposits pay for bank branches you resent having to go into anyway? You always expected technology would revolutionize how you handle your money. This is what that looks like. We believe we have the best technology, the best team, and a vision that puts your needs at the center of our business model. (Your old bank only puts your needs at the center of their marketing strategy, or at least that\u2019s how it looks to us.)<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So today the interest rate on the cash account is going up. We\u2019re thrilled about it. We will always do everything in our power to pass along the absolute most savings to you. And as we continue to build your one-stop financial hub, we\u2019re going to keep you in the loop. We\u2019ll always tell you exactly what\u2019s happening with your money and why. In the meantime, rest easy knowing your cash is growing even faster than it was yesterday, and we\u2019re perpetually looking for more levers to pull to make your money go even further.<br><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Since we launched the cash account in February, our clients have earned over $10 million in interest, more than 23 times as much as their money would have earned in a traditional savings account.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":129,"featured_media":10601,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[7234],"tags":[1051,1058,6836],"yst_prominent_words":[1509,6902,3049,6903,2625,1739,6475,6901,1237,2782,2771,6906,1240,6905,5418,1693,6904,1297,6478,6476],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/10600"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/129"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=10600"}],"version-history":[{"count":12,"href":"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/10600\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":13026,"href":"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/10600\/revisions\/13026"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/10601"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=10600"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=10600"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=10600"},{"taxonomy":"yst_prominent_words","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/yst_prominent_words?post=10600"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
