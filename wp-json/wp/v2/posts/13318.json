Read more about it <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/the-wealthfront-cash-account-apy-is-decreasing-to-0-10-percent\/\">here<\/a>\n.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wealthfront is <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wealthfronts-new-mission\/\">building a financial system that favors people<\/a>, not institutions. Over the last eight years, we\u2019ve built best-in-class, innovative products that benefit our clients. Our low-cost, tax-minimized, automated investing service changed the investment management landscape forever, and now, we\u2019re reinventing banking.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Banks aren\u2019t built to benefit you \u2013 they\u2019re built to benefit banks. When we built the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/cash\">Wealthfront Cash Account<\/a>, we used technology to build what you actually want from a financial institution. We started with a competitive APY that puts more money in your pocket, and prioritized features that would benefit you. <strong>Now, the Cash Account is getting even better with checking features that allow you to direct deposit your paycheck, pay bills and friends, make purchases with a debit card, and access your cash via a network of fee-free ATMs.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typical banks make you manage multiple accounts: a savings account for earning interest and a checking account for everyday spending. They charge you unnecessary and exorbitant fees, and often put restrictions and requirements on how you can use your accounts. On top of that, they don\u2019t pay you the interest you deserve on all of your cash. But with the Cash Account, you can earn more money on all your money (5x the interest compared to traditional financial institutions per FDIC.gov) and conveniently access the everyday checking features you need in one place. It\u2019s not a checking or savings account: it\u2019s an account that combines the best elements of both.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What\u2019s new with the Cash Account?&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cash Account already comes with a 0.35% APY, no account fees, unlimited free transfers, and up to $1 million in FDIC insurance through our partner banks. Now it\u2019s getting even better with account and routing numbers and the Wealthfront Visa debit card.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"485\" height=\"530\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/fastcash-blog-phone-full-4-485x530.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13325\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/fastcash-blog-phone-full-4-485x530.png 485w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/fastcash-blog-phone-full-4-458x500.png 458w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/fastcash-blog-phone-full-4-768x839.png 768w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/fastcash-blog-phone-full-4-1406x1536.png 1406w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/fastcash-blog-phone-full-4-1875x2048.png 1875w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 485px) 100vw, 485px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is everything you can now do with the Wealthfront Cash Account:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211;<strong>Get your paycheck up to two days early.<\/strong> Use your routing and account numbers to direct deposit your paycheck with your Cash Account so you start earning interest as soon as the deposit hits your account.

You can now use your account and routing numbers to pay bills like your credit card, rent, or mortgage \u2013 whatever you want. You can also make purchases directly with Apple Pay and Google Pay, and pay friends with Venmo, Cash App, and PayPal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211;<strong>Get cash from 19,000 fee-free ATMs nationwide<\/strong>.
