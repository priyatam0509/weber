Wealthfront is one of the first financial services companies to implement Face ID, and we couldn&#8217;t be more excited to add another way to ensure your security. And for those lucky enough to get the iPhone X today, we encourage you to check it out.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn.wealthfront.com\/public.email.images\/blog_facetoface.gif\" width=\"250\" height=\"498\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This is the second innovation we\u2019ve adopted focused on facial recognition. Earlier this year we introduced our college planning feature within our financial planning solution. To make the experience more personal, we invite you to upload a photo of your child into your plan. We do the cropping and centering for you via Apple&#8217;s machine learning-based face detection so you can upload in one tap.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn.wealthfront.com\/public.email.images\/blog_facetoface_college.gif\" width=\"250\" height=\"495\" \/><\/p>\n<p>At Wealthfront our goal is to help you live the life you want, and we do that by delivering sophisticated financial solutions and innovative product experiences.
