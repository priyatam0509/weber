Be sure to use a unique password for each financial site you use.<\/li>\n<li><b>Keep your machine clean and up-to-date.<\/b> Make sure you have the latest copy of a virus and malware software package to protect your machine. Also, set your software to automatically update whenever possible. Many operating system or application updates contain important security fixes; enabling automatic updates will ensure your device is protected as soon as a fix is available.<\/li>\n<li><b>Never share your password with others.<\/b> A Wealthfront representative will never ask for your password; neither should anyone else.<\/li>\n<li><b>Avoid suspicious links and questionable websites.<\/b> In a common type of fraud called \u201cphishing,\u201d you might receive an email with a link to a copycat website that prompts you to enter your username and password. The operators of these sites will then use this information to gain access to your accounts. Protect yourself by carefully checking a link&#8217;s destination before you click and verifying the internet address of any site requesting your username or password.<\/li>\n<li><b>Enable Two-Step Authentication wherever available.<\/b> By requiring both a username and password as well as a one-time use verification code, two-step authentication provides an extra layer of security, especially in cases where your credentials may have been compromised.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Your security is importance to us, and at Wealthfront we are always working to make your account security simple and effective.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\">Join us.<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>At Wealthfront, the security of the assets and data you have entrusted with us is of paramount importance.
