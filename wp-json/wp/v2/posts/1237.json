As a money manager I interviewed said on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/blog\/markets-diving-heres-sell-money-managers\/\">Monday<\/a> (and I paraphrase), if you were overweighted in equities to the point where you are not able to meet your obligations if the market slides again or can\u2019t sleep at night, sell. If not, consider how the changing market conditions fit in with your portfolio strategy, and make adjustments as necessary.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What\u2019s ahead?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In this <a href=\"http:\/\/video.ft.com\/v\/1102800838001\/Uncertain-times-for-Asian-markets-\">video interview<\/a> from the <em>Financial Times<\/em>, independent economist Andy Xie predicts volatility, not a prolonged downturn.

Bond prices plummeted farther than they had on any single day in three years, writes Ms. Shlaes, \u201cAs for stock shares, they were down between $2 and $15, the greatest drop in six years.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It was the start of the so-called Roosevelt Recession within the Depression. Angry that the private sector wouldn\u2019t spend money to help pull the nation out of the Depression, Roosevelt levied a tax on profits. Companies were on what Roosevelt called a \u201ccapital strike.\u201d They no longer had the cash reserves to retain employees; they also stopped investing in equipment.<\/p>\n<p>Unemployment spiked that year, but slowly began trending down again, and then the need to fight facism overtook both economic and political concerns.<\/p>\n<p>Ms. Shlaes\u2019s summary at the end of the book: \u201cThe story of the mid-1930s is the story of a heroic economy struggling to recuperate but failing to do so because of perverse federal policy.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I took two lessons from her work: that long recoveries from financial crises contain many unnerving ups and downs, and second, that we need a new New Deal \u2013 because the first one, built of entitlements that have grown unaffordable, has outlived its effectiveness.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What should investors do?
