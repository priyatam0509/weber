Clients have flooded us with positive feedback about this feature, which until now, has only been available to those who have invested $100,000 or more. So we did what we always do when you tell us you like something: We found a way to make it available to even more people.<\/p>\n<h2>So how does this work? Here\u2019s the rundown.<\/h2>\n<p>Our Portfolio Line of Credit is designed to be effortless. There\u2019s no application, no credit check, no obnoxious paperwork. A few clicks and you\u2019re done. You\u2019ve spent longer looking up your bank\u2019s routing number. And once the ball is rolling, your money gets to you quickly, usually in 1-3 business days.<\/p>\n<p>And the interest rate? Folks, it\u2019s good. Because your line of credit is secured by your investments, we\u2019re able to keep the interest rate nice and low (currently 4.75% &#8211; 6.00% depending on account size). Compare that to credit cards and home equity lines of credit, which require a merciless amount of paperwork, take weeks (aka, forever) to get your money, and carry higher interest rates.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-10139 size-medium aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/productlaunch_lowerploc_blog_comparisonv3-640x400.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/productlaunch_lowerploc_blog_comparisonv3-640x400.png 640w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/productlaunch_lowerploc_blog_comparisonv3-768x480.png 768w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/productlaunch_lowerploc_blog_comparisonv3-848x530.png 848w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/productlaunch_lowerploc_blog_comparisonv3.png 1472w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/p>\n<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Current Portfolio Line of Credit rates depend on account size.

What we <em>can<\/em> do is arm Wealthfront clients with products that make financial planning and maneuvering as painless as possible \u2014 and that includes enduring a tax season full of changes that might have you facing a more daunting tax bill than in years past. The Portfolio Line of Credit can quickly give you the liquidity you need to take on your taxes without your investments and goals taking the hit.<\/p>\n<p>Managing an unruly tax bill without knocking your financial plans off the rails is far from the only use for a Portfolio Line of Credit (and probably the least fun, to be honest). This is an effortless option when you need some quick cash to cover a bill (credit card, tuition, medical expenses) or to kick off a large purchase, like a new car or home renovation. Want to invest in your friend\u2019s new venture or get your own startup off the ground? Wealthfront\u2019s Portfolio Line of Credit is a fast and easy way to inject cash where you need it, no hoops to jump through \u2014 and you can pay it back on your own timeline.\u00a0The interest accrues until you\u2019re ready to pay back the loan, so you don\u2019t even need to make monthly payments.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn.wealthfront.com\/public.email.images\/productlaunch_lowerploc_blog_usecases.gif\" width=\"1472\" height=\"725\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Making good things and then making them better.<\/h2>\n<p>Our target is to create an integrated, personalized money ecosystem that empowers you to see the full scope of your financial life and gives you the agility you need to reach your goals at the right time \u2014 without having to open a dozen apps and log in to multiple sites.
