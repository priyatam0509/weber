Back then, many Americans wanted the federal government to step in to stabilize the banks.<\/p>\n<p>Now, the backlash is developing \u2013 and Wall Street\u2019s soft underbelly is not what happened during the financial crisis, but what has happened since. The financial services industry has gone on, \u201cbusiness as usual,\u201d making big profits off a system often criticized for its conflicts of interest. In March, <a href=\"http:\/\/blogs.wsj.com\/economics\/2011\/03\/25\/like-the-phoenix-u-s-finance-profits-soar\/\"><em>The Wall Street Journal<\/em> reported that<\/a>:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAfter rising like the Phoenix, the financial industry now accounts for about 30% of all operating profits. That\u2019s an amazing share given that the sector accounts for less than 10% of the value added in the economy.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>One key turn in the Occupy Wall Street protests is that what started as a backlash against Wall Street has broadened to include a sweeping anger against \u201cbig corporations\u201d and, to some extent, the wealthy. The protests have become threaded with the strain of populism that organized labor and the Democrats historically have relied on as political fuel.<\/p>\n<p><em>Business Insider\u2019s <\/em>Henry Blodget wrote about <a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/what-wall-street-protesters-are-so-angry-about-2011-10?op=1\">what protestors are angry about<\/a>. His series of charts illustrates the unemployment rate, the kinds of workers who are unemployed, the role of big corporations, and then loops back to Wall Street. Mr. Blodget criticizes Wall Street for making money without producing, well, much of anything.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;When you can borrow money for nothing, and lend it back to the government risk-free for a few percentage points, you can COIN MONEY. And the banks are doing that. According to the IRA, the &#8216;net interest margin&#8217; made by US banks in the first six months of this year is $211 Billion. Nice!&#8221; writes Mr. Blodget.<\/p>\n<p>Are the protests being driven by a populist backlash against the wealthy or against the practices of financial services, which is prospering as a kind of remora on the rest of our economy?<\/p>\n<p>Last week, we saw an enormous embrace of billionaire Steve Jobs. Few questioned whether he deserved to be rich; I suspect that is because he produced ideas and products of value to individuals and to the economy.<\/p>\n<p>My read is that the anger of the protestors is being driven by a sense of something deeply amiss in an industry that now touches everyone\u2019s lives \u2013 something writers have been delving into on the Wealthfront blog:<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a post that looks at the way the mutual fund industry uses an asset-weighted average to report mutual fund fees: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/blog\/ignore-average-cost-mutual-funds\/\">Why Investors Should Ignore The \u2018Average\u2019 Cost of Mutual Funds<\/a>.

Here\u2019s a roundup of news and blog posts that show both the growing strength of the movement and the possibility that it might all scatter and drift away.<\/p>\n<p>A small group of Wall Street West protestors shut down a Wells Fargo in San Francisco, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fogcityjournal.com\/wordpress\/3095\/occupy-wall-street-protesters-shut-down-wells-fargo-over-foreclosure-crisis\/\">reports Fog City Journal<\/a>. The estimated number of protestors was only a few dozen.<\/p>\n<p>This <a href=\"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/2011\/10\/13\/occupy-wall-street-protests_n_1008539.html\">Huffington Post piece<\/a> includes a series of updates from protests around the country. Friday morning, correspondents reported that police had broken up protests in Denver, but that in New York the planned cleanup-by-force of Zuccotti Park had been delayed.<\/p>\n<p>Famous people appeared, <a href=\"http:\/\/online.wsj.com\/article\/SB10001424052970204774604576627550884848120.html\">writes David Weidner of <em>The Wall Street Journal<\/em><\/a>: \u201cWhat a buzz kill \u2026 In Los Angeles, protesters had to suffer Rosanna Arquette. You know, the actress and subject of a 1980s song by the band Toto.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>President Obama sought to ally himself with the protestors, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/white-house-ties-obama-to-occupy-wall-street-2011-10?nr_email_referer=1&amp;utm_source=Triggermail&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=Politix%20Select&amp;utm_campaign=Politix%20Select%202011-10-12\">reported Business Insider<\/a>. (It\u2019s worth noting that the more the protests target an amorphous \u201cwealthy\u201d the safer they are for Democratic politicians. That\u2019s because even the Democrats don\u2019t like to take on Wall Street, which is the source of much of the campaign funds for both parties.
