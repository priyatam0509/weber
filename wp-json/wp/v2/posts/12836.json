Read more about it <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/the-wealthfront-cash-account-apy-is-decreasing-to-0-10-percent\/\">here<\/a>\n.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re living in extraordinary times. On Sunday, March 15 the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) lowered the target range for the federal funds rate by 1.00% to 0%\u20130.25% because of concerns about the impact of the coronavirus COVID-19 on economic activity. The cut (which was the second surprise rate cut this month) occurred ahead of the FOMC\u2019s scheduled meeting later this week and was accompanied by news of a $700 billion quantitative easing program. These actions reflect just how unusual the current situation really is.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we\u2019ve written before, a decrease in the fed funds rate means we need to decrease the interest rate we pay on the Wealthfront Cash Account, too. We are lowering our interest rate (APR) by 1.00%, which <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/how-do-interest-rates-work-heres-everything-you-need-to-know\/\">due to compounding, translates<\/a> to an APY decrease of 1.01%. This means the APY on our Cash Account is changing from 1.27% to 0.26%.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We know that these are difficult times for everyone and it\u2019s particularly painful to also see the APY on your Cash Account cut. We understand, and we empathize. While we cannot control the fed funds rate (or news headlines or financial markets), we are committed to being transparent in our communications and continuing to build the best products we can.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What does this mean for you?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s what a lower APY on your Wealthfront Cash Account means for your money: a 1.01% rate decrease means that every $1,000 in your account will now earn $10.10 less in annual interest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why is the rate going down?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The partner banks where we broker our deposits pay us a rate based on a fixed premium to the effective federal funds rate (EFFR). This means that <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/how-the-fed-funds-rate-impacts-the-wealthfront-cash-account\/\">when the EFFR declines, our rate also declines.<\/a> Because we are a broker-dealer, regulations do not allow us to pay out a rate in excess of what our partner banks pay us. As a result, we are forced to lower the rate on the Wealthfront Cash Account whenever the Fed lowers rates. We want to pay you more, but we can\u2019t.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even with a lower rate, you\u2019ll still enjoy everything you love about your Wealthfront Cash Account, which comes with unlimited free transfers, no fees, and FDIC insurance up to $1 million through our partner banks. And we\u2019re hard at work on features that will make your Cash Account even better: late this spring we\u2019ll add debit cards, direct deposit, and the ability to pay bills.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Will the rate go up?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We can\u2019t predict what the Fed will decide in the future. We expect the federal funds rate to go back up eventually, but we don\u2019t know exactly when that will be. We do know this: when the Fed raises interest rates, we\u2019ll increase our rate, too.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Our commitment to you<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>These are uncertain times, but our commitment to you remains the same. We\u2019ll deliver innovative products that earn our clients more money on all their money and make it easy to manage their financial lives. While some things are out of our control, we are here for you and we remain committed to rewarding our clients as much as we can.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While we can\u2019t pay out more interest at this time, we will continue to <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/sweepstakes\/\">give away a total of $100,000<\/a> by giving $25,000 to one winner each week over the next four weeks per our announcement on Friday. Cash Account clients are automatically entered to win \u2013&nbsp;there\u2019s nothing else you need to do.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We appreciate your continued trust in us and promise to remain transparent with you about these changes.
