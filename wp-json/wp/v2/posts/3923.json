Our average client now trusts us with over $80,000, with accounts varying in size from $5,000 to over $5 million.<\/p>\n<p>Our success has also allowed us to attract <a title=\"Wealthfront Investment Team\" href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/expertise\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">exceptional financial expertise<\/a>, including our chief investment officer, Dr. Burton Malkiel, as well as some of the top software talent that helped build companies like Facebook and LinkedIn.<\/p>\n<h2>Dreaming Big<\/h2>\n<p>Decades ago, Charles Schwab offered young Baby Boomers the ability to place trades directly. Vanguard gave everyone access to efficiently run index funds. Those businesses grew up with the Baby Boom generation and now manage more than $4 trillion in assets between them.<\/p>\n<p>At Wealthfront, our typical clients are in their 30s. We offer them what we believe everyone deserves: access to low-cost, tax-efficient, diversified portfolios. The members of Gen Y are just beginning to accumulate the wealth their families need. We plan to grow with them the way our predecessors grew up with the Baby Boomers.<\/p>\n<p>Wealthfront is just getting started. <a title=\"Explore Wealthfront\" href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/c\/blog250M\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Join us<\/a> on the journey.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>At Wealthfront, we believe everyone deserves sophisticated investment management.
