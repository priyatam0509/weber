If this describes you, don\u2019t despair! There\u2019s still time left before 2016 draws to a close to make some meaningful decisions, which is why we put together a checklist of important tasks you should consider before the New Year.<\/p>\n<p><b>Top off your emergency fund<\/b><br \/>\nGive yourself and your family the gift of an emergency fund. We typically suggest you set aside three to six months of your monthly spending, but everyone\u2019s situation is different. To help determine what\u2019s right for you, we suggest you read <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/build-emergency-fund\/\">Build the Emergency Fund That\u2019s Right for You<\/a>. Our recommendation is to keep your emergency fund in a low-risk, liquid account such as a money market fund or savings account \u2013 do not invest your emergency fund in the market!<\/p>\n<p><b>Harvest your losses to lower your tax bill<\/b><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/tax-loss-harvesting\">Tax-loss harvesting<\/a> is a method of reducing your taxes by selling an investment that is trading at a significant loss and replacing it with a highly correlated though not identical investment. In doing so, you maintain the risk and return characteristics of your portfolio and generate losses that can be used to reduce your current taxes. The tax savings you generate can then be reinvested and will compound over time.<\/p>\n<p><b>Pay down your credit card debt<\/b><br \/>\nCredit cards typically charge as much as 18% on your outstanding balances, so paying off your debt is the equivalent of getting a risk free 18% return. There is no investment product that offers that kind of risk adjusted return.<\/p>\n<p><b>Pay down your student debt<\/b><\/p>\n<p>If you have money left over after contributing to your emergency fund and paying down your credit card debt, then you should consider paying down or refinancing your student debt if it charges an interest rate of 6% or more. Again, paying down debt with a 6% interest rate is like getting a risk-free 6% return, which even Wealthfront can\u2019t match. You might also consider refinancing your student loans through some new companies like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.earnest.com\">Earnest<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><b>Contribute to your 401(k) account<\/b><br \/>\nAs we explained in <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/401k-retirement-plan-fees\/\">Why Your 401(k) Plan Sucks<\/a>, it makes tremendous sense to contribute at least as much this year to your 401(k) account <b><i>as your employer is willing to match<\/i><\/b>. If your employer does not offer matching contributions, then you are likely better served investing your savings in a Wealthfront IRA or taxable account. Fortunately, you have until April 15th of next year to contribute to an IRA and still get the tax deduction for 2016, so you don\u2019t need to be in a rush if you choose the IRA over the 401(k) option.<\/p>\n<p><b>Don\u2019t exercise your stock options if you can wait<\/b><br \/>\nUnless you are worried about your employer\u2019s stock price dropping precipitously before year end, you should consider deferring your exercise until after December 31st. That will defer the tax you owe from exercising your options until the 2017 tax year, which you may not have to pay until April 2018.<br \/>\n<b>Open a 529 college savings plan account for your kids<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The IRS has given parents an incredible gift to help them save for their child\u2019s college education costs \u2013 the 529 college savings plan. When it comes to planning for your family, few things have the potential to prove as financially rewarding as enrolling early in a 529 and growing your savings tax free. That\u2019s why <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/529\">Wealthfront launched its own 529 this fall<\/a>. In <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/529-college-education-savings-plan-2\/\">529 Plans and Saving for College<\/a> we cover the basics from the types of accounts available and their pros and cons to giving you an idea of how much you\u2019ll likely need to save.<\/p>\n<p><b>Superfund your 529 college savings plan<\/b><br \/>\nIf you are fortunate enough to have a more substantial amount of money, superfunding a 529 offers significant benefits both in terms of objective savings results, as well as from a behavioral finance perspective. Instead of the $14,000 annual contribution limit, each parent can pre-fund up to five years\u2019 worth of contributions, up to $70,000 (5 x $14,000). Together, that means a married couple can open a 529 plan with $140,000 for each child and get even more value from compounding the larger contribution from the outset. We explain the benefits of superfunding in greater detail in <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/529-plans-benefits-superfunding\/\">529 Plans: The Benefits of Superfunding<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><b>Spend down your FSA<\/b><br \/>\nIf you have a flexible spending account for health care expenses, usually referred to as a health FSA , and you haven\u2019t used all the money in it, you\u2019ll need to use the bulk of it before the end of the year. &nbsp;If you don\u2019t use of it by year end, plan sponsors have the option to allow employees participating in health FSAs to carry over, instead of forfeiting, up to $500 of unused amounts remaining at year-end. Check with your plan sponsor to see if this option is available to you. A key difference between these types of accounts and a health savings account is that the latter allows you to roll over all your funds year to year.<\/p>\n<p><b>Give a tax-deductible charitable contribution<\/b><br \/>\nNow is a good time to donate to a cause you believe in and simultaneously benefit from it on your 2016 taxes. Just remember \u2013 a tax deduction only saves you a fraction of the total amount you donate, so make that charitable contribution because you&nbsp;really want to support the cause and not just for the potential tax write-off. Giving directly to causes is also deemed a good alternative for those wrestling with whether to pursue a socially responsible investing strategy.<\/p>\n<p><b>Claim your <\/b><b>residential energy efficient property credit<\/b><br \/>\nIf you, as an individual homeowner who has considered purchasing residential alternative energy equipment, such as solar hot water heaters, solar electricity equipment, etc., you should consider this tax credit. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/credits-deductions\/individuals\/residential-energy-efficient-property-credit-section-25d-at-a-glance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The credit<\/a> runs through 2016 for qualified geothermal heat pumps, small wind turbines and fuel cell property placed in service by December 31, 2016 and has been extended for solar electric property and solar water heating property&nbsp;placed in service through December 31, 2021. &nbsp;For 2016, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/newsroom\/energy-incentives-for-individuals-residential-property-updated-questions-and-answers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the credit is 30%<\/a><sup>2<\/sup> of the cost of qualified equipment. And <a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/newsroom\/get-credit-for-making-a-home-energy-efficient\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">according to the IRS<\/a> this generally includes labor costs when figuring the credit, and you can carry forward any unused portions of this credit.<\/p>\n<p><b>Review your insurance policies <\/b><br \/>\nMake sure you and your loved ones are well protected if something happens to you. Now is a good time to consider whether any major life changes, like the birth of a child in the past year, might mean the need for insurance. If you do have enough coverage, it\u2019s still a good time to review the different types of coverage you have. As we explained in <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/whole-vs-term-life-insurance-investment\/\">Why Whole Life Insurance Is a Bad Investment<\/a>, term life insurance makes more sense for most young people than whole or universal life insurance. And while it might seem like a bad time to do so, it is actually a good time of the year to gently review with parents or elders their own coverage. Long-term care coverage for older parents is one area often overlooked, even by many financial advisers. Also, many retiring boomers fail to consider how much they will have in the way of out-of-pocket healthcare costs post-retirement. If you want to perform a quick back-of-the-napkin calculation to estimate these costs for an older parent or loved one check out this <a href=\"https:\/\/hvsweb1.hvsfinancial.com\/hvadvisor\/\">free one-click cost calculator<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><b>Turn on Stock-level Tax-Loss Harvesting in your Wealthfront account<\/b><br \/>\nIf you are a Wealthfront client who has invested at least $100,000 with us in a taxable account, there\u2019s no time like the present to opt in to our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/tax-optimized-direct-indexing\">Stock-level Tax-Loss Harvesting service<\/a>. Stock-level Tax-Loss Harvesting is unique in that the more money you invest, the greater the potential tax benefit. That\u2019s because the more you invest, the more securities you own. The more securities you own, the greater the opportunity for harvesting losses.<\/p>\n<p><b>Review your spending and set up automated savings<\/b><br \/>\nAs our CIO Dr. Burt Malkiel says \u201cStart saving early and save regularly.&nbsp;You will do very, very well over time and likely have a very happy retirement when the time comes.\u201d To do that, you need to reflect on your spending and develop a budget for next year. So, take advantage of the time you have during the holidays and bite the bullet. A great step after setting a budget for 2017 is to take the pressure off and just automate your savings to your emergency fund and your investment accounts.

Yes, we are intentionally reiterating the point of saving regularly.<\/p>\n<p><b>Roll over your old 401(k) into an IRA<\/b><br \/>\nMost 401(k) plans are poor performers and the fees you pay on them add up (as we pointed out in <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/401k-retirement-plan-fees\/\">Why Your 401(k) Plan Sucks<\/a>). If you leave one company for another, it\u2019s usually a bad idea to roll your 401(k) over into your next employer\u2019s 401(k) unless you\u2019re lucky enough to find one of the few good plans that offer Vanguard index and target date funds. Consider rolling your old 401(k) over into a low cost, set it and forget it Wealthfront IRA.<\/p>\n<p>We want to sincerely thank all of our clients who trust us every day with their hard earned money.
