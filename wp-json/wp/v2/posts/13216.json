Wealthfront stands against racism and white supremacist ideology. We are outraged by the police brutality, racial violence, and the long history of anti-Black policies in this country. All of us must commit to real action. We\u2019ve spent the past few days listening, learning, and reflecting on what enduring actions we\u2019re committed to taking to make a lasting impact. We\u2019d like to share them with you now.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an immediate response, we are focused on educating ourselves and engaging in activism. We are marching in protests, holding safe space discussions to support one another and share personal experiences, and convening study sessions on citizen activism. Our employees are contributing financially to causes that we believe will have an impact on racial equality. We are dedicating employee time to signing petitions including <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wecantbreathenational.org\/\">#wecantbreathe<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.naacp.org\/campaigns\/we-are-done-dying\/\">NAACP\u2019s #WeAreDoneDying<\/a>, and calling elected officials to demand legislative changes. We\u2019re also working on a new initiative to help members of communities of color in the Bay Area to register to vote.\u00a0<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not enough and we have much more to do. To us, lasting change comes from direct citizen action, not brand statements. In collaboration with our employee resource groups (ERGs), we are collectively committed to fighting against racism in the following ways:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>First, we vow to continue to deepen our understanding of the issues.<\/strong> We recognize that in order to make lasting change, we need to do our homework. Our ERGs have organized educational events on diversity and inclusion in the past, and we are committed to continuing to host these events. We\u2019re looking forward to our study group on citizen activism and the upcoming meeting of our ERG Book Club \u2013 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.penguinrandomhouse.com\/books\/224792\/just-mercy-movie-tie-in-edition-by-bryan-stevenson\/\">Just Mercy<\/a> is our current read. We\u2019ve listed our recommended readings at the bottom of this post and encourage you to check them out.&nbsp;<\/li><li><strong>Second, we will foster a culture of community action.<\/strong> We\u2019ve put together lists of organizations to support and petitions to sign. We\u2019re driving donations to organizations including <a href=\"https:\/\/blacklivesmatter.com\/\">Black Lives Matter<\/a> in Oakland, <a href=\"https:\/\/eji.org\/\">Equal Justice Initiative<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.splcenter.org\/\">Southern Poverty Law Center<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/fairfight.com\/\">Fair Fight<\/a> for voter enfranchisement. You can find our full list of the organizations and petitions at the bottom of this post. <\/li><li><strong>Third, we are committed to giving our time.<\/strong> Wealthfront employees have the full support of the company in taking paid time off from work to participate in the events that are meaningful to them. Many of them have done so already, and we encourage all employees to show up for the causes they care about. <\/li><li><strong>Fourth, we will partner long-term with organizations focused on creating opportunities for underserved youth in our local communities. <\/strong>We\u2019ve appreciated previous opportunities to share our time and resources with Bay Area organizations dedicated to issues important to the Black community and other underrepresented communities. We will identify a few local organizations to partner with for the long-term and will direct our time and energy towards them. We hope that by building deeper connections, we can develop more empathy and drive more lasting change for our community.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We founded our ERGs a few years ago. Upfront supports people of color, Outfront supports the LGBTQ+ community, WoW supports the women of Wealthfront, and Allies includes members of the majority group who support and amplify the work of our other ERGs. They\u2019ve done tremendous work in helping all of us better understand the issues that matter and take action. We thank them deeply for their contributions. But it\u2019s extremely clear that we cannot just rely on our ERGs to do the work. We, as a broader Wealthfront community, need to show up and stand up in this fight. It\u2019s tragic and shameful that it\u2019s taken recent events to spark meaningful conversations in this country on racism. We vow to do better.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">\u2013\u2013\u2013<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking to better understand the system of racism and how to take action?
