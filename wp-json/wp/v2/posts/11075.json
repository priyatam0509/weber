Read more about it <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/the-wealthfront-cash-account-apy-is-decreasing-to-0-10-percent\/\">here<\/a>\n.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, the annual percentage yield (APY) on the Wealthfront Cash Account decreased from 2.07% to 1.82%. This change comes as a result of the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to once again lower the target federal funds rate by 0.25% to 1.75%. While a lower APY isn\u2019t exactly news we want to give you, this new rate is still one of the highest interest rates in the market, according to Bankrate.com.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the clearest terms, here\u2019s what a lower APY on your Wealthfront Cash Account means for your money: a 0.25% rate decrease means that every $1,000 in your account will now earn $2.50 less in annual interest.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Why is the rate going down?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The partner banks where we broker our deposits pay us a rate based on a premium fixed to the fed funds rate. So when the fed funds rate declines, our rates decline by an equal amount. As a broker-dealer we are not allowed to pay out a rate in excess of what the banks pay us, so we are forced to lower rates on the Wealthfront Cash Account whenever the Fed lowers rates.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But even with a lower rate, you\u2019ll still enjoy everything else you love about your Wealthfront Cash Account \u2014 unlimited free transfers, no fees, and your cash is covered by FDIC insurance for up to $1 million through our partner banks. And coming soon, you\u2019ll also get bill pay, direct deposit, and ATM cards.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Another way to grow your money<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While we know that the lower APY is a bummer, the Wealthfront Cash Account (or a high-yield savings account in general) is not the only way to grow your money \u2014 particularly the money you don\u2019t plan to spend in the next few years. In fact, we believe that the money you\u2019re saving for the long term (greater than five years) should be invested in a portfolio of low-cost index funds.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Investing is the right way to grow your money <em>for the long term<\/em>. Here\u2019s why: history has shown that financial markets generally rise over the long run. For example, Wealthfront taxable investment accounts have realized <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/historical-performance\">4-8% in annual, net-of-fees, pre-tax returns<\/a> since inception in 2011, depending on risk score.* That\u2019s why, in order to maximize your wealth over the long term, we recommend that any cash you don\u2019t need in the short term should be invested rather than kept in a high yield cash account.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We recommend investing that extra money in a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/investing\">Wealthfront investment account<\/a>, made up of a globally diversified portfolio of low-cost index funds. Our software automatically rebalances your portfolio, minimizes your taxes through tax-loss harvesting, and efficiently manages your risk \u2014 all at an industry-low cost. You can fund your new investment account right in the app with a transfer from your cash account or a linked bank account. And your Wealthfront app lets you easily move money between your Wealthfront Cash Account and investment accounts so your money is always exactly where you want it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>A gift to you<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We know how important your money is to you. That\u2019s why we believe it\u2019s imperative to understand how best to grow it for both the short and long term. This weekend, we\u2019re offering to manage $5,000 for free on your first Wealthfront investment account \u2014 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/app\/account-type\">just open an account by Sunday 11\/3 at 11:59 pm EST<\/a> to benefit from this offer.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you already have a Wealthfront investment account, you know how easy Wealthfront makes it for you to invest and start saving towards your long-term goals \u2014 so spread the word. You\u2019ll receive an additional $5,000 managed for free when you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/invite\">refer someone<\/a> to open a Wealthfront Cash Account or investment account.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wealthfront isn\u2019t just a place to help you stash your short-term cash. We\u2019re also here to help you plan and grow your money for the long term. We\u2019ve built a consolidated financial ecosystem that makes it simple for you to see your entire financial picture and manage your savings and investments without having to log in and out of multiple accounts.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We promise to be 100% transparent with you if anything changes and always pass on as much interest as we possibly can. We also promise that we will always provide you with the best advice we can \u2014 especially when times get a little tougher.
