Read more about it <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/the-wealthfront-cash-account-apy-is-decreasing-to-0-10-percent\/\">here<\/a>\n.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, the annual percentage yield (APY) on the Wealthfront Cash Account decreased from 1.82% to 1.78%. This change comes as a result of a decrease in the effective fed funds rate, which directly impacts the rate we can pay to you.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s what a lower APY on your Wealthfront Cash Account means for your money: a 0.04% rate decrease means that every $1,000 in your account will now earn $0.40 less annually. The good news \u2014 you\u2019re still earning over 19x more on your money than the national average with the Wealthfront Cash Account<sup>1<\/sup>, and our rate is still higher than what\u2019s offered by popular banks with high-interest savings accounts like Goldman Sachs\u2019s Marcus and Ally Bank.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why is the rate going down?&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past, we\u2019ve had to lower the interest we pay when the Federal Reserve made a cut to the target fed funds rate. However, <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/what-impacts-the-rate-we-can-pay-on-the-wealthfront-cash-account\/\">as we explained in our previous blog post<\/a>, a decrease in the <em>effective fed funds rate <\/em>can also cause us to cut our rates. While the Federal Reserve sets a target range for the fed funds rate, that\u2019s all it is \u2014 a target. In reality, the federal funds rate is determined by supply and demand for borrowing between banks. This rate, called the <em>effective fed funds rate<\/em>, fluctuates daily and is a direct input in the interest rate we can pay to you.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to setting the interest rate on our cash account, we aim to pass as much interest on to clients as possible, while offering a stable rate. To do so, we keep a small rate cushion so you don\u2019t have to experience the daily volatility of the effective fed funds rate and we don\u2019t run the risk of paying a higher rate than we earn from our program banks \u2014 something our regulators don\u2019t allow. The size of the cushion is meant to handle almost all expected rate volatility based on historical experience. However, we\u2019re living through unusual times. Last night, the effective fed funds rate declined to a rate below our cushion, and per the legal requirements of our regulators, we had to lower the rate of the Wealthfront Cash Account today.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Unprecedented volatility in the effective fed funds rate<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Historically, the effective fed funds rate, which fluctuates daily, trades close to the middle of the Federal Reserve\u2019s target range. As you can see, when we launched our Wealthfront Cash Account in February 2019, the target range was 2.25% to 2.5% and the effective fed funds rate hovered close to 2.40%. However, over the last year, the effective fed funds rate has seen unprecedented levels of volatility, moving wildly outside of the middle of the target range. And beginning in November, when the Federal Reserve lowered the target rate to 1.50% to 1.75%, the effective fed funds rate started to trade at the <em>low end of the range<\/em>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1324\" height=\"530\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Target-Fed-Funds-Range-vs-Effective-Fed-Funds-Rate-1324x530.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-12440\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Target-Fed-Funds-Range-vs-Effective-Fed-Funds-Rate-1324x530.jpg 1324w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Target-Fed-Funds-Range-vs-Effective-Fed-Funds-Rate-640x256.jpg 640w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Target-Fed-Funds-Range-vs-Effective-Fed-Funds-Rate-768x307.jpg 768w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Target-Fed-Funds-Range-vs-Effective-Fed-Funds-Rate-1536x615.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Target-Fed-Funds-Range-vs-Effective-Fed-Funds-Rate-2048x820.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1324px) 100vw, 1324px\" \/><figcaption>Source: Federal Reserve Bank of New York (01\/01\/2019 &#8211; 01\/10\/2020)<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Our pledge remains to pass along as much benefit as possible<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We know that seeing decreases in the APY on your cash account is an uncomfortable experience. So to ensure as much stability in your rate as possible going forward, we\u2019ve set our new 1.78% APY to correspond to what our program banks would pay based on the bottom of the target range of the fed funds rate. By doing so, we hope to provide enough cushion so that we minimize changes in the rate we pay going forward.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But even with a lower rate, you\u2019ll still enjoy everything else you love about your Wealthfront Cash Account \u2014 unlimited free transfers, no fees, and your cash is covered by FDIC insurance for up to $1 million through our partner banks.
