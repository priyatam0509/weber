(It\u2019s truly time for people who came of age as investors during the 1990s to let go of that halcyon time of double-digit returns!)<\/p>\n<p>\u201cDiversification is not only the first important thing investors should think about, but the second and the third, and probably the fourth and fifth, too,&#8221; he said. He explained that it is worth taking the risk of betting against the collective judgments of other investors only when you know far more than they do about an investment. For most people, this won\u2019t happen very often.<\/p>\n<p>For the buy-and-hold philosophy to work, it must be applied not just to stocks but across an entire portfolio, including bonds and other assets, he said. That is because the stock market is, above all else, &#8220;spasmodic,&#8221; in his words.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight: bold;margin-bottom: 12pt\">Shifting emotions, global concerns<\/h3>\n<p>Early in the week, the Web was consumed by the Census Bureau\u2019s report that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.latimes.com\/business\/la-fi-poverty-census-20110914,0,6473161.story?track=rss\">poverty had reached a 50-year high<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Then the question preoccupying the buzz-makers became, What\u2019s next? Another recession? By week\u2019s end, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/2011-09-15\/consumer-prices-in-u-s-increase-0-4-core-gauge-rises-0-2-.html\">indications of a weak U.S. economy<\/a> had been overtaken by hope that European leaders will be able to avert a financial crisis there. News broke of a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/2011-09-15\/ecb-coordinates-with-federal-reserve-in-lending-dollars-to-euro-area-banks.html\">plan to lend dollars to Eurozone banks<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>What happens to investments when the news is bad? People yank their money. Covering Morningstar\u2019s monthly report on mutual funds, <a title=\"Morningstar on mutual fund overflows\" href=\"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/2011\/09\/14\/idUS155628+14-Sep-2011+PRN20110914\" target=\"_blank\">Reuters pointed out<\/a> that August marked the most severe mutual fund outflows since November 2008. ETFs gathered assets, but at a slower pace. \u00a0We wonder where those yanked assets are sitting now.<\/p>\n<p>We believe investors should look critically at their mutual fund holdings, but what\u2019s going on here has little to do with critical thinking, and more to do with following the herd. If the news is so frightening you feel the need to do something, consider drops in the market as an opportunity to tweak your portfolio in search of bargains.

This <a href=\"http:\/\/www.economist.com\/blogs\/buttonwood\/2011\/09\/equity-investing\">Economist columnist<\/a> posits that the reason for U.S. equities\u2019 historically high returns was the nation\u2019s position as history\u2019s winner in the 20<sup>th<\/sup> century.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"font-weight: bold;margin-bottom: 12pt\">The effect of money<\/h3>\n<p>That giant sucking sound you hear is Wall Street vacuuming up the top college graduates. The pay is so much higher in finance that it proves irresistible even to people whose natural inclinations lean toward science or technology. (Average wages at the big banking firms for employees in securities are upward of $300,000, and average bonuses for everyone top $120,000 a year, according to the New York State Comptroller.)<\/p>\n<p>What happens when the smartest minds end up on Wall Street?
