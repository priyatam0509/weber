Unfortunately very little has been written about how an acquisition affects the average tech worker financially. \u00a0With all the recent news of multi-billion dollar acquisitions, it\u2019s too easy to forget that not every acquisition leads to a windfall for its employees.<\/p>\n<p>In my experience there are four types of acquisitions:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Fire Sale<\/li>\n<li>The Acqui-hire<\/li>\n<li>The Modest Price<\/li>\n<li>The Exceptional Price<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Each acquisition type leads to very different outcomes for the employees.<\/p>\n<h2>The Huge Role of the Liquidation Preference<\/h2>\n<p>Before describing the different types of acquisition outcomes employees might experience we first need to explain <i>liquidation preference<\/i>, a term of the Convertible Preferred Stock issued to venture capitalists that plays a crucial role in the distribution of acquisition\/merger proceeds among investors and employees.<\/p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/stock-options-versus-rsu\/\" target=\"_blank\">How Do Stock Options and RSUs Differ?<\/a>, we explained how venture capitalists came to acquire Convertible Preferred Stock in startups so as to enable stock options to be priced at a fraction of the price they paid. In order to justify a lower price for stock options to the IRS, the Convertible\u00a0Preferred Stock issued to the venture capitalists had to <i>appear<\/i> more valuable than the Common Stock issued to employees. I say appear because it was highly unlikely the Preferred Stock\u2019s unique rights would ever come into play.<\/p>\n<h2>Participating Preferred: The Double Dip<\/h2>\n<p>Liquidation preference was one of the critical terms designed to create the illusion of greater value for the Convertible Preferred Stock. \u00a0Liquidation preference grants the investors preferential rights (thus the term <i>Preferred<\/i> Stock) in the case of the sale of the company. It can take one of two forms, straight, more commonly known as <i>classic,<\/i> and <i>participating<\/i>. Classic preference grants investors the right to choose whether to have all their invested money returned or to have it converted into common stock and thus receive a share of the proceeds equal to their ownership stake.\u00a0 Because the investors have preference, they receive all proceeds in a sale that values their company at less than the amount invested.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s look at a <i>classic preference<\/i> example. If venture capitalists and angels collectively invested $20 million for a 20% stake in a company that is sold for $200 million, the investors have the right to either get their $20 million back \u2014 or convert to Common and get 20% of the proceeds which in this case equals $40 million.\u00a0\u00a0 The Common shareholders, which include stock option and RSU holders, would share the remaining proceeds proportionally or <i>pro-rata<\/i>.<\/p>\n<p>The graph below displays the amount of money Investors and Common shareholders would receive at different acquisition values.\u00a0 The Investor line has a slope of 1.0 below $20 million because the investors get all the proceeds up until that point.\u00a0 The Investor line then flattens from an acquisition price of $20 million to $100 million because the Investors would opt for their $20 million of preference and the remainder would go to the Common shareholders (thus the slope of 1.0 for the Common curve between $20 million and $100 million).\u00a0 Above $100 million, the Investors would convert, so the slope of their line changes to 0.2 (the percentage of the proceeds they would receive).<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/2014-04-28_ClassicPreffered.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-4446\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/2014-04-28_ClassicPreffered.jpg\" alt=\"2014-04-28_ClassicPreffered\" width=\"536\" height=\"435\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/2014-04-28_ClassicPreffered.jpg 765w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/2014-04-28_ClassicPreffered-616x500.jpg 616w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/2014-04-28_ClassicPreffered-653x530.jpg 653w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 536px) 100vw, 536px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>With <i>participating preference<\/i> the investors receive the right to get their money back <b>and<\/b> share in the <i>remaining<\/i> proceeds according to their ownership. Using the previous example, in the $200 million scenario the investors would receive $56 million ($20 million plus 20% of $180 million) and in the $100 million sale scenario they would receive $36 million ($20 million plus 20% of $80 million).\u00a0 Because participating preferred gets their money back first and shares the remainder pro-rata, it\u2019s often referred to as a <i>double-dip<\/i> (it\u2019s intended as a pejorative term because it\u2019s considered excessively generous to the investors).<\/p>\n<p>In the graph below you can see how in the participating case the Investors receive incrementally more money as the acquisition price increases.\u00a0 The rate of the increase drops from 100% of the incremental proceeds to 20% once an acquisition price of $20 million has been reached.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/2014-04-28_ParticipatingPref2.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-4448\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/2014-04-28_ParticipatingPref2.jpg\" alt=\"2014-04-28_ParticipatingPref2\" width=\"549\" height=\"419\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/2014-04-28_ParticipatingPref2.jpg 784w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/2014-04-28_ParticipatingPref2-640x488.jpg 640w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/2014-04-28_ParticipatingPref2-768x586.jpg 768w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/2014-04-28_ParticipatingPref2-695x530.jpg 695w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 549px) 100vw, 549px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s possible for employees to get far less than their expected ownership stake when the preference clause is triggered.\u00a0 That\u2019s because they only share what remains after the preference has been distributed to the investors.\u00a0 Let me use an example to illustrate. Say you\u2019re an engineer who works for the company that raised $20 million for a 20% ownership stake with a <i>participating preferred<\/i>.\u00a0 That means the employees collectively own 80% of the company.\u00a0 If the company were sold for $100 million, $36 million would be allocated to the investors (as we explained above) and $64 million to the employees.\u00a0 Our engineer would get her pro-rata share of the proceeds available to the employees, which would equal $400,000 ($64 million x 0.5%\/80%).\u00a0 That\u2019s <b>20% less<\/b> than the $500,000 she expected based on her ownership percentage (0.5% x $100 million). As you can now see the amount of money an employee can expect to receive in an acquisition is not only based on her ownership percentage, but the company\u2019s sale value, amount invested and whether or not her company was able to avoid <i>participating preferred<\/i> (it should be noted that like all other convertible preferred stock terms, liquidation preference goes away once a company goes public).<\/p>\n<h2>Acquisition Outcomes Explained<\/h2>\n<p><b>The Fire Sale<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The first and most dreaded type is the fire sale. This usually takes the form of an asset sale, meaning the acquirer buys the company for its assets (intellectual property, distribution relationships, customer base) rather than its ongoing business. Asset sales are usually valued <i>below<\/i> the amount of money invested in the business, which results in the investors receiving all the proceeds because of their liquidation preference. The only employees who receive anything in this case are a few senior members of management who typically receive a small share (less than 10%) of the proceeds from the investors as an incentive to stick around and get the company sold. Seldom do rank and file employees ever see any money in this scenario. To make matters worse few of the employees are retained in this kind of acquisition because the acquirer doesn\u2019t intend to maintain or grow the acquired business.<\/p>\n<p><b>The Acqui-hire<\/b><\/p>\n<p>An acqui-hire is a type of acquisition used to recruit coveted employees rather than add a new line of business. An acqui-hire typically only occurs when a startup fails to build a business and has run out of money. The founders are willing to join the acquirer to save face, find a soft landing for their employees and earn a reasonable amount of money over a short period of time. Most acqui-hire acquisitions are consummated before a startup has raised venture capital and are usually valued at less than $10 million.<\/p>\n<p>To illustrate, an acquisition offer of $6 million can be very attractive if a startup has eight sought-after employees, has raised $1 million from angels, is about to run out of money and hasn\u2019t found product\/market fit. In this scenario the angels would get their $1 million back and the acquirer would allocate the remaining $5 million across the eight employees according to how valuable they might be to the acquirer.<\/p>\n<div class=\"pullquote-right\">\n<p class=\"pullquote\">Perhaps the most important issue for you to determine when joining a company \u2014 if major financial success is a top consideration \u2014 is your potential employer\u2019s rate of momentum. The fastest growing companies have the highest odds of going public or getting acquired in the <b>exceptional<\/b>\u00a0scenario.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>Often acquirers use acqui-hires to hire people they otherwise couldn\u2019t attract given the constraints of their equity compensation plans. Equity distributed in an acqui-hire is often a few times as large as what an employee could expect to receive if she joined the acquiring firm through the normal recruiting process. In some instances vesting schedules will be lengthened as part of the acquisition and\/or additional options might be issued. Once an acqui-hire is consummated the newly acquired employees are likely to be re-assigned to projects of interest to the acquirer, not the projects on which they were working which might not be to their liking.<\/p>\n<p><b>The Modest Price <\/b><\/p>\n<p>In this scenario the acquirer pays a price that may range from $50 million to $300 million. This can be attractive, from a financial perspective, for the rank and file employees depending on how much capital has been raised and whether <i>participating preference<\/i> was granted. The less capital raised the better for the employees. In this scenario the acquirer often issues additional equity to the most valued employees to ensure they stick around for a while. These additional grants are often known as <i>golden handcuffs<\/i>.<\/p>\n<p>Options issued to employees who work for the acquired company are converted into options of the acquirer. The proportion of the option exercise price to the acquisition price is maintained in the newly converted options to purchase the acquiring company\u2019s stock.<\/p>\n<p>For example, let\u2019s say a senior engineer had an option to purchase 75,000 shares of the acquired company\u2019s stock for $0.50 per share and the acquisition price is $4.00 per share in the form of Common Stock. Let\u2019s further assume the acquirer\u2019s stock is priced at $24 per share. The engineer\u2019s options would be converted into an option to purchase 12,500 shares of the acquirer\u2019s stock at an exercise price of $3.00 per share. You\u2019ll notice the engineer\u2019s profit remains the same despite the change in shares and exercise price.<\/p>\n<p>The employee vesting schedules usually carry over into the new company. By that I mean that an employee who was 50% vested before the acquisition will be 50% vested in the new company. Sometimes employees receive a slight acceleration in their vesting upon acquisition, but usually only if their jobs were eliminated as part of the acquisition. Companies that are acquired for a modest price are often folded into existing operations run by the acquiring company, which implies less autonomy than as an independent company.<\/p>\n<p><b>The Exceptional Price<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The last scenario is the case where the acquiring company pays what many consider an outrageous price to buy a company that is of great strategic value. Instagram, YouTube and WhatsApp are classic examples of this type of acquisition. We explained the economics of the WhatsApp acquisition in great detail in <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/whatsapp-acquisition-employees\/\" target=\"_blank\">WhatsApp: What an Acquisition Means for Employees<\/a>. In this case the acquisition price is so high that liquidation preference has little or no impact on the economics for the acquired employees. The acquired employees still have to vest their stock and are usually granted tremendous autonomy because any company that can command a billion dollar price can secure a great deal of independence as a term of the deal. In many of the outrageously priced deals employees are given additional incentives in the form of stock options or RSUs to ensure they stick around. The logic is that if the acquirer paid a huge price then it would be penny wise and pound foolish not to issue additional incentives to make sure that key people remain.<\/p>\n<h2>What can you do to protect yourself?<\/h2>\n<p>In <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/stock-options-14-crucial-questions\/\" target=\"_blank\">The 14 Crucial Questions About Stock Options<\/a> we listed a number of questions you should ask about your offer to give you the best odds of faring well in an acquisition.
