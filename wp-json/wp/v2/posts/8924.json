Does that sound like you? Didn\u2019t think so. We believe you should live the life <i>you<\/i> want, not what others deem to be appropriate. Your job is to imagine the possibilities of your life, and our job is to put you on the financial path to get there. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve built a planning experience to help you achieve a range of life aspirations, including homeownership, covering your kids\u2019 college costs, and an early retirement.<\/p>\n<p>But recently, we\u2019ve heard a strong desire from many of our clients to explore one particular possibility \u2013 taking extended time off from work to travel. You don\u2019t want to wait until the traditional retirement age to see the world, but you might not be sure if you have the financial means to go on that big adventure now. So to help you with this challenge, we&#8217;re excited to introduce the newest addition to our planning experience \u2013 Time Off for Travel.<\/p>\n<h3><b>Let us guide you towards your journey<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s easy to dream about extended travel, but then reality hits and you\u2019re left with questions. How much time off can I afford to take? Will it affect my lifestyle when I return? How frugal will I have to be on the road?<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s where Time Off for Travel can help. By connecting to all your financial accounts, Wealthfront has a bird\u2019s-eye view of what you have today and what you\u2019re expected to have in the future. We can immediately tell you how long you can afford to travel without putting your long-term financial security at risk.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn.wealthfront.com\/public.email.images\/Travel_months.gif\" width=\"254\" height=\"550\"><\/p>\n<p>As you dream up how your time off may look, there are a number of aspects we can help you consider:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>When can you afford to leave? Immediately or maybe in a few years?<\/li>\n<li>How long can you afford to be away? Just a few months or more than a year?<\/li>\n<li>What will your travel style cost you, whether it\u2019s hostel hopping or luxury rentals?<\/li>\n<li>Can you expect any income while you\u2019re away? Any freelance projects or subletting your home?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn.wealthfront.com\/public.email.images\/Travel_explore.gif\" width=\"254\" height=\"549\"><\/p>\n<p>As you explore the specific details with Time Off for Travel, we\u2019ll help you understand how these different aspects affect the affordability of your trip. We\u2019ll even let you know how the scenario you\u2019ve imagined will impact your ability to retire the way you want.<\/p>\n<p>We also provide actionable advice on how you can make your extended trip a reality. We\u2019ll tell you how much to save per month to cover the cost of your trip while staying on track for other goals like buying a home or an early retirement.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-8953 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Travel_savings_plan.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"254\" height=\"426\"><\/p>\n<h3><b>A word from a few veteran globetrotters<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>We were particularly excited to build Time Off for Travel because we could sense our clients\u2019 passion when they spoke about this specific ambition. Today, we celebrate those who\u2019ve forged unconventional paths by sharing four stories about the value of extended time off. We found these travel experiences truly inspiring, and we hope you will as well.<\/p>\n<div class=\"travel-carousel\">\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/time-off-travel-kate-kyle\"><br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/themes\/wealthfront-chisel\/client-stories\/images\/kylekate.png\" alt=\"Kyle &amp; Kate\" width=\"314\" height=\"451\" border=\"0\"><\/a>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5>Kyle &amp; Kate<\/h5>\n<p>How to logistically (and financially) prepare for a 12-month world trek <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/time-off-travel-kate-kyle\">\u2192<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/time-off-travel-judy\"><br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/themes\/wealthfront-chisel\/client-stories\/images\/Judy.png\" alt=\"Judy\" width=\"314\" height=\"451\"><\/a>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5>Judy<\/h5>\n<p>Transitioning into a new (and better) job after a one-year sailing trip <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/time-off-travel-judy\">\u2192<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/time-off-travel-andrew\"><br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/themes\/wealthfront-chisel\/client-stories\/images\/andrew.png\" alt=\"Andrew\" width=\"314\" height=\"451\"><\/a>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5>Andrew<\/h5>\n<p>Moving into a new career after 7 months at an NGO in Tanzania <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/time-off-travel-andrew\">\u2192<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"\"><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/time-off-travel-dan\"><br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/themes\/wealthfront-chisel\/client-stories\/images\/dan.png\" alt=\"Dan\" width=\"314\" height=\"451\" border=\"0\"><\/a>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5>Dan<\/h5>\n<p>How 2 years making ramen in Japan changes your life outlook <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/time-off-travel-dan\">\u2192<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h3><b>Adventure is out there<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>There\u2019s something undeniably appealing about spending time on the road, making new connections, visiting new places, and having experiences that you\u2019d never have at home. This sentiment couldn\u2019t be summed up better than by one of our travel heroes, Anthony Bourdain, who we couldn\u2019t help but think of today:<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cTravel isn\u2019t always pretty. It isn\u2019t always comfortable. Sometimes it hurts, it even breaks your heart. But that\u2019s okay. The journey changes you; it should change you. It leaves marks on your memory, on your consciousness, on your heart, and on your body. You take something with you. Hopefully, you leave something good behind.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>We admire those who dare to imagine, and we built our financial planning to make their dreams a reality.
