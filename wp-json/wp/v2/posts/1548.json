Groupon&#8217;s IPO in particular is viewed as setting the tone for other highly anticipated tech IPOs like Zynga Inc. and Facebook Inc.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>One small Silicon Valley company, <a href=\"http:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/q?s=impv\">Imperva<\/a>, has already ridden the IPO wave, issuing <a href=\"http:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/Imperva-shares-jump-after-IPO-apf-1915665176.html?x=0&amp;.v=2\">five million shares of stock on Wednesday to raise $90 million<\/a>.

Ms. Hermle, who does not represent Zynga, said the practice happens at other companies, too.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI have not seen it publicized but it does happen,\u201d she said, citing attorney-client privilege for not naming the companies. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s a negotiation and sometimes it\u2019s a fight.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><em>The Financial Times<\/em> said <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ft.com\/intl\/cms\/s\/0\/5997a58a-0bf5-11e1-9310-00144feabdc0.html\">the move challenged the traditional pay structure of Silicon Valley<\/a>, which has rewarded early employees of startups with lottery-like winnings.<\/p>\n<h1>The sun shines in California.
