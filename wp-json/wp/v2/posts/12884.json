But it also means that right now the markets are effectively \u201con sale.\u201d Investing in the markets now is a lot less expensive than it was a few weeks ago.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"c-embed c-embed--video\"><iframe title=\"What should I do if my investment account is down a few weeks or months?\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/GOcDn689FSU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<\/div><figcaption><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=GOcDn689FSU&amp;feature=emb_title\">Video: Wealthfront<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/top-investor-mistake-time-market\/\">never recommend trying to time the market<\/a>. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.institutionalinvestor.com\/article\/b1ck6rht2kz8x1\/No-You-Almost-Certainly-Can-t-Time-Markets\">Studies have shown<\/a> that even professional investors don\u2019t consistently get it right. But if you\u2019ve been waiting to start investing for the long term \u2014 and by that, we mean investing money you don\u2019t anticipate needing within 3-5 years \u2014 there\u2019s really no excuse not to start now. We\u2019re currently in a bear market, and <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/theres-no-need-to-fear-a-bear-market\/\">our historical analysis shows<\/a> that bear markets recover in well under two years on average. That means on average, investors who stayed invested after a bear market have historically earned more than a 20% return over the next 1.7 years. Investing in these conditions can work to your advantage, as you\u2019re buying when prices are low and you\u2019ll be in the market for the recovery.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How should you invest? First and foremost, we think you should use a long-term passive investing strategy because it\u2019s a time-tested approach that consistently leads to much better outcomes. We don\u2019t encourage stock-picking as an investment strategy, although as with all things, <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/stock-picking\/\">it\u2019s fine in moderation<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ready to get started? Here are four important elements of a sound investing strategy.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1. Get the basics right<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To use a long-term passive investing strategy, set up a diversified portfolio of low-cost index funds that aims to maximize your returns while keeping you in your risk comfort zone. Once you\u2019ve done that, you\u2019ll need to make sure your portfolio maintains the right investment mix for your risk tolerance \u2014 otherwise, your portfolio makeup will drift over time.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wealthfront builds a diversified portfolio for you after assessing your risk tolerance and then automates best practices so you don\u2019t have to worry about the details like rebalancing, dividend reinvestments, and tax-loss harvesting. We do this for a range of account types that are suited to a variety of long-term goals. We offer taxable investment accounts for general investing (individual, joint, and trust), retirement accounts (traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs, SEP IRAs, and 401(k) rollovers), and college savings (529 plans).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. Keep an eye on fees<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/fees-can-destroy-return\/\">Fees can destroy your return<\/a>, so it\u2019s important to be conscious of the fees you\u2019re paying when you invest. Many advisors will charge commissions, transfer fees, and account closing fees just to name a few.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wealthfront believes in keeping your fees as low as possible. We use low-cost ETFs and only charge a low 0.25% advisory fee, which is about a quarter of what most investment managers charge.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3. Minimize your taxes<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of investing is accepting that some things are out of your control: market performance and volatility, for example. But you can work to minimize the taxes you\u2019ll owe on what you earn, leaving more money in your pocket.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wealthfront offers an unparalleled suite of tax-minimization features. Our software assesses each individual\u2019s portfolio and automatically executes these strategies when we determine they\u2019re beneficial to your account. Our <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/real-value-tax-loss-harvesting\/\">Tax-Loss Harvesting <\/a>\u00a0and <a href=\"https:\/\/support.wealthfront.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/211005023-What-is-Stock-level-Tax-Loss-Harvesting-\">Stock-level Tax-Loss Harvesting<\/a> take advantage of daily market volatility to harvest losses that can be used to offset your taxable gains, and our <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wealthfronts-portfolio-rebalancing-just-got-even-better\/\">rebalancing methodology<\/a> is sensitive to the taxes you\u2019ll incur when your account is rebalanced. We also minimize your taxes while <a href=\"https:\/\/support.wealthfront.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/210998783-Will-Wealthfront-handle-my-transferred-assets-tax-efficiently-\">transferring between brokerage accounts<\/a> and when you <a href=\"https:\/\/support.wealthfront.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/211007423-How-does-Wealthfront-choose-which-investments-to-sell-when-I-withdraw-\">make withdrawals<\/a>.\u00a0<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>4. Prioritize convenience<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Wealthfront believes in building products that make it easy to manage your financial life. This means whether you use our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/investing\">investment accounts<\/a>, our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/cash\">Cash Account<\/a>, or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/planning\">planning experience<\/a>, all of it can be done on your phone.

Financial markets have historically increased in value in the long run, and we don\u2019t expect this time to be any different. It\u2019s not possible to time the market, and we don\u2019t think you should try. But if you\u2019re saving for the long term, now\u2019s a great time to consider investing and building wealth for the future.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As the coronavirus COVID-19 has spread, the world has experienced an unusually high level of market volatility.
