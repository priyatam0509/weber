Read more about it <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/the-wealthfront-cash-account-apy-is-decreasing-to-0-10-percent\/\">here<\/a>\n.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve lowered the target federal funds rate by 0.25% to 2.25%, marking the first rate decrease since we launched the Wealthfront Cash Account. This necessitated a decrease in the APY on the Wealthfront Cash Account from 2.57% to 2.32%, still a top-of-market rate that\u2019s 23 times higher than what your bank likely pays you, according to Bankrate.com.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re not thrilled to see the APY on our cash account go down a little \u2014 it\u2019s a bummer no matter how you look at it \u2014 but we\u2019ve always been prepared for this. The federal funds rate may fluctuate, but our commitment is unshakable: we will continually offer the highest interest rate we can and relentlessly look for ways to reduce costs so we can pass along more savings to you, no matter what the market throws at us.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Let\u2019s unpack what happened and talk about what it means for you and your money.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First, a little background: The fed funds rate is the rate at which banks lend each other funds overnight, so a rate decrease, like the one we saw yesterday, affects nearly every financial institution and thus consumers directly. And the impact isn\u2019t all bad: when the rate goes down, so do mortgage rates. But the rates on high-yield savings accounts and Certificates of Deposit (CDs) go down, too. This includes the Wealthfront Cash Account.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what does this mean for your money? As a result of this APY decrease, every $1,000 in your cash account will now earn $2.50 less in annual interest. Even with this change, we\u2019ll continue to get you the highest rate we possibly can.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s how we do that: Wealthfront\u2019s business model is entirely based on leveraging technology to <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/how-the-high-interest-rate-on-wealthfront-cash-accounts-does-what-banks-refuse-to-do\/\">strip away the high overhead costs that traditional financial institution<\/a>s are still dragging around. It\u2019s how we\u2019re able to deliver you best-in-class investment management for just 0.25%. It\u2019s how the APY on the cash account is still at the top of the market. Banks won\u2019t offer you the high APY you get on your Wealthfront Cash Account because <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/how-the-high-interest-rate-on-wealthfront-cash-accounts-does-what-banks-refuse-to-do\/\">it simply costs them too much money to run their business<\/a>. Their inefficiencies become your loss. We are single-minded about finding every possible way to help your money work harder and grow faster for you. This means that even when the Fed lowers rates, you\u2019re still going to get more from us than you would from traditional banks.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If paying attention to the fed funds rate feels new to you, that\u2019s not surprising. You might\u2019ve cared more in the past if your old bank had actually passed along any available interest to you, which they likely did not. When your cash was sitting in a traditional bank savings account \u2014 not earning any interest for you while making money for your bank \u2014 you wouldn\u2019t have ever felt the impact of a rate cut. It\u2019s a real \u201cwhen you have nothing, you have nothing to lose\u201d situation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But with Wealthfront, you have something. Once you have a high APY on your cash and feel what it\u2019s like to have your money growing for <em>you<\/em>, a Fed rate cut feels personal. We get that. We had to lower our rate because of the Fed\u2019s decision, but that doesn\u2019t change what <em>we\u2019re<\/em> about. We\u2019ll always tell you what\u2019s going on with your rate and why, while obsessively looking for new ways to preserve the highest rate we can for you. And along the way, you\u2019ll still enjoy everything else you love about Wealthfront and our cash account. The essential differences between us and traditional banks will keep benefitting you, and market fluctuations like this only serve to prove it. When conditions aren\u2019t at their most favorable, that\u2019s when you really know who has your back.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The federal funds rate may fluctuate, but our commitment is unshakable: we will continually offer the highest interest rate we can and relentlessly look for ways to reduce costs so we can pass along more savings to you, no matter what the market throws at us.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":129,"featured_media":10768,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[7234],"tags":[1051,6900,6992,1058,6836],"yst_prominent_words":[1509,6631,1739,6475,6292,6285,6896,6892,2614,6290,6997,6996,1240,5418,6980,6895,6904,1297,6478,6476],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/10765"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/129"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=10765"}],"version-history":[{"count":12,"href":"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/10765\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":13025,"href":"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/10765\/revisions\/13025"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/10768"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=10765"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=10765"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=10765"},{"taxonomy":"yst_prominent_words","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/yst_prominent_words?post=10765"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
