You now have densely organized lists of \u201cmust-have\u201d and \u201cnice-to-have\u201d features like open floor plans and built-in shelves and original floors. Whenever someone asks you where you\u2019re looking to maybe buy a place, you practically recite a TED Talk breaking down your top five neighborhoods. You\u2019ve sidelined other non-essential savings goals in favor of diligently funneling all extra cash into a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/cash\">high-yield cash account for your down payment<\/a>. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You are beyond ready. This is it: You and your partner are going to buy a home. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/home-guide\">buying a house<\/a> is obviously exciting, it\u2019s also one of the biggest financial decisions you\u2019ll ever make. And when you\u2019re buying a home with your partner, the process and the implications of buying a home will undoubtedly show what your relationship is really made of. With that in mind, while you\u2019re in the ecstatic throes of letting your nesting fantasies run wild (please don\u2019t let us stop you), make sure you and your partner are <em>also <\/em>being duly diligent by collaboratively answering these six important questions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1. &#8220;Why do we want to buy a house <em>now<\/em>?&#8221;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re not talking about \u201cbecause everyone else is doing it.\u201d (Although honestly, who are we to tell you that being competitive with your peers isn\u2019t a totally valid motivator?) There are countless good reasons to want to buy a home, but the quality of your experience in this process will be greatly determined by how aligned you and your partner are on goals, priorities, and expected outcome. If one of you is looking at this as an investment and the other is just looking for a dreamy place to settle down until death do you part, you\u2019re going to be butting heads the whole time and risk turning an exciting time into a contentious one. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe you both want to buy a home because of the general belief that \u201crenting is throwing money away.\u201d That\u2019s often (but not always!) true. To analyze whether or not it\u2019s smart to buy in your city, you have to weigh a number of factors. Or rather, Wealthfront can help you weigh a number of factors using our home buying planning feature, which basically tells you everything you need to know to make a plan based on <em>your <\/em>finances. We use current home prices through a Redfin integration to show you what it takes to buy a place in different markets, and if anything changes \u2014 your location, your financial circumstances, or the housing market \u2014 Wealthfront will automatically update the plan for your home buying goal. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wealthfront\u2019s free home planning feature has access to such expansive, real-time data that you don\u2019t really have to do much heavy lifting (or any lifting, to be honest) when it comes to watching the housing market. We can show you what\u2019s currently happening with home prices and what they\u2019re likely to do in the future. But still be mindful about circumstances in neighborhoods where you\u2019re possibly looking to buy, especially if you\u2019re aiming to invest in a home with potentially appreciating value. Are new developments rapidly popping up to keep up with growing demand or are there building regulations (maybe tied to preserving historical structures or natural land features) that prevent denser building, thus driving up demand for a limited number of properties? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"245\" height=\"530\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/8-1-245x530.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10374\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/8-1-245x530.png 245w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/8-1-231x500.png 231w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/8-1.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 245px) 100vw, 245px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think about your future plans too. Since the short-term costs of home ownership are high, it\u2019s a good idea to hang onto a property for at least five years, both to cover the transaction costs associated with buying and selling and to allow your property\u2019s value to appreciate. If you know you\u2019re going to be bouncing from your current city in two years and aren\u2019t interested in continuing to own a home without living in it, you might be better off renting for now. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Buying a home is one of those things it\u2019s easy to feel like you\u2019re just \u201csupposed to do\u201d at a certain point, so before you make any definite moves, it\u2019s just a good idea to know <em>why <\/em>you\u2019re both interested in making this purchase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. &#8220;How much can we <em>really<\/em> afford?&#8221;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re not trying to start a fight, but you knew this was coming! You have to talk about budget. To be more specific, you have to <em>agree <\/em>on a budget. Before getting too far in the process, it\u2019s essential to figure out your price ceiling. If you don\u2019t, you might end up with an endless series of battles over budget with your partner (a dark cloud over what should be a fun time in your relationship) or worse yet, you could end up with a house you can\u2019t afford, which will inevitably mean even more stress and fighting in the future. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>*Cracks knuckles* <\/em>This part of the game is exactly why<em> <\/em>we built our free home planning feature. Want to see how much you can afford based on where you want to live and your current income? What about if you move or change jobs? What if you waited a few years? What if you save up and put down a bigger down payment? <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/home-planning\">We can help you play with all the variables<\/a> that impact your home-buying budget. All the little details you would usually be left to juggle yourself \u2014 your income, net worth, credit score, and debt-to-income ratio \u2014 when figuring out how much you can afford and what kind of mortgage you\u2019re likely to qualify for? We\u2019ve got all of that covered, with the added context from data-driven housing market forecasts. Also, it\u2019s totally free, which is unlikely to be true about any other part of your home-buying journey. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-gallery aligncenter columns-3 is-cropped\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"245\" height=\"530\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/3-245x530.png\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"10361\" data-link=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/?attachment_id=10361\" class=\"wp-image-10361\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/3-245x530.png 245w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/3-231x500.png 231w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/3.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 245px) 100vw, 245px\" \/><\/figure><\/li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"245\" height=\"530\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/9-245x530.png\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"10363\" data-link=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/?attachment_id=10363\" class=\"wp-image-10363\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/9-245x530.png 245w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/9-231x500.png 231w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/9.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 245px) 100vw, 245px\" \/><\/figure><\/li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"245\" height=\"530\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/10-245x530.png\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"10364\" data-link=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/?attachment_id=10364\" class=\"wp-image-10364\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/10-245x530.png 245w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/10-231x500.png 231w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/10.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 245px) 100vw, 245px\" \/><\/figure><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use your Wealthfront account to get extremely accurate projections about the impact to <em>you <\/em>if you buy different homes in different places at different times within different budgets, but if detailed numbers based on your exact financial landscape aren\u2019t your thing, here\u2019s a back-of-the-envelope calculation that can help you determine your budget:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Limit your <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/home-guide#all-in-costs\"><strong>debt-to-income ratio (DTI) to 33% or lower<\/strong><\/a><strong>.<\/strong> Your DTI takes your projected monthly housing expenses, including insurance and taxes, and all your debts, including housing, student loans, and car payments, and divides them by your gross monthly income. To appease both lenders and your budget, you should aim to keep your DTI under 33% ideally. Once your DTI goes above 44%, it becomes much more difficult to secure a mortgage. As a general rule, allow yourself to spend, at most, three to five times your household income. If you have significant debt, shoot for the lower end. If you\u2019re debt free, you can go higher, although you certainly don\u2019t have to. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of this will help you avoid buying more house than you can afford, even if your lender approves you for more. The truth is, <em>you<\/em> should decide what your budget is and try to find a lender who will support that \u2014 don\u2019t wait for a lender to set your budget for you. If you don\u2019t shy away from looking at the numbers and making firm decisions about what you can afford, you don\u2019t need anyone else making that call \u2014 and potentially making the wrong-for-you call \u2014 about your budget. It\u2019s why we built our home planning feature in the first place: What the bank agrees to loan you effectively sheds <em>no <\/em>light on what that amount of debt will do to the rest of your financial plans, let alone giving you insight into how changing any number of variables could put you in a better position overall. &nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"245\" height=\"530\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/12-1-245x530.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10373\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/12-1-245x530.png 245w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/12-1-231x500.png 231w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/12-1.png 375w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 245px) 100vw, 245px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have those figures, consider how much you\u2019ve saved for a down payment. Ideally, you\u2019ll put down at least 20% of the purchase price. Not only will that reduce your interest rate and long-term costs, but it will eliminate the need for private mortgage insurance (PMI). On a $300,000 mortgage, for example, avoiding PMI could potentially save you as much as $250 each month.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, you should set aside an additional 5% for closing costs and unexpected repairs. Then, going forward, you should keep 1% to 3% of your home\u2019s value in an <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/build-emergency-fund\/\">emergency fund<\/a> to account for super fun surprises like a broken water heater or a leaky roof. (Wait, is renting suddenly looking more appealing?) <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3. &#8220;How do our credit scores look?&#8221; <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Next up: credit scores. Yes, this <em>does <\/em>keep getting more fun. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Request both your and your partner\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/annualcreditreport.com\">credit reports<\/a>, and check them carefully for any errors. The last thing you want is to find your dream home and then get held up on getting approved for a mortgage because of erroneous items on your credit report. They can be fixed, but not overnight, so don\u2019t wait to scan for them once you\u2019re already rushing to put in an offer. Credit reports looking clean? Now pull your credit scores. Most mortgage lenders use FICO credit scores, which you can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.creditkarma.com\/\">get free<\/a>.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since lenders look at a range of factors, including your DTI, down payment, and credit report when <a href=\"https:\/\/www.consumerfinance.gov\/about-us\/blog\/7-factors-determine-your-mortgage-interest-rate\/\">determining your mortgage interest rate<\/a>, you want them all in fighting shape. Though it might not sound significant, a 0.5% lower interest rate could <a href=\"https:\/\/www.consumerfinance.gov\/owning-a-home\/explore-rates\/\">save you a significant amount of money<\/a> over 30 years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>4. &#8220;What do we want the most?&#8221; <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Numbers aren\u2019t the only things you need to come to terms with. Like any other part of scoping out your shared life, planning to buy a home means mutually committing to priorities. What does your dream house look like, and where is it located? Are you salivating over the stainless steel appliances of a modern condo? Or the screened-in porch of a quaint craftsman? <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you\u2019re creating your wish list, make sure to account for what your future selves might want, too. If you plan to have kids, research the best school districts; if you plan to <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/rental-property-investing\/\">turn this property into a source of extra income<\/a>, look for an area popular with renters. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s no shortcut to examining the many possible priorities here. Just dive in. Is it more important to get more space or have a more perfect location? Are you more focused on resale potential or proximity to where you work? Do you want a quiet street more than you want to be in a particular school district? We don\u2019t have enough room to list all the trade-offs you two have to agree on. It might be effortless or it might be a painful process involving hard-to-swallow compromises. Either way, we recommend doing it over a box of donuts or bottle(s) of wine. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5. &#8220;How much work are we willing to put in?&#8221;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Fixer-uppers can be so tempting: The prices are lower, and the idea of DIY-ing as a couple (or, okay, hand-picking the perfect contractors) is super romantic. But while the concept of a \u201chouse that needs work\u201d can seem like a lovely adventure to embark on together, the reality is that it is&#8230;actual work. That can be sincerely appealing to some people and a total burden to others. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/l0HUelwK6VUmlSPwk\/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\" \/><figcaption><em><a href=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/l0HUelwK6VUmlSPwk\/giphy.gif\">Giphy<\/a><\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>So before throwing cash into a potential money pit, consider how much time you and your partner will want to devote to its renovation. Are you willing to trade in your weekend hikes and NFL-and-nachos sessions for hammers and paint and saying things like \u201cwow, maybe that <em>was <\/em>a load-bearing wall\u201d? There\u2019s no right or wrong way to feel about buying a home anywhere on the unfinished-to-polished spectrum, but you and your partner should definitely make sure you\u2019re looking for the same thing.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From a financial standpoint, a fixer-upper can be an incredible investment. Since you can\u2019t typically borrow the costs of remodeling, you\u2019ll need to put up both the down payment <em>and <\/em>the cash for remodeling\/renovation, so the cost of entry (if we\u2019re talking about the finished home) is higher than if you bought a house that didn\u2019t need work. But if you\u2019re in a position to go for it \u2014 and you actually <em>want <\/em>to \u2014 buying a fixer-upper is a great way to build equity and end up with a home you really love.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you are mutually agreed that you want to buy a home that is fully move-in ready, home ownership in general means a long list of ongoing maintenance tasks, like mowing the lawn and cleaning the gutters. It\u2019s also good to take a moment to discuss whether you\u2019re going to hire help or do those chores yourself, and if it\u2019s the latter, who\u2019s going to be responsible for what. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>6. &#8220;What happens if we break up?&#8221; <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, yes, this is a downer, but hear us out because it\u2019s important. Your love might feel unshakable now, but as it goes with financial planning, you can use all known information to make educated projections about what is likely to happen in the future and invest accordingly in the present, but you can\u2019t <em>know <\/em>how <em>anything <\/em>will ultimately turn out. Your relationship might be the smartest investment you can imagine making, but&#8230;life happens. Unimaginable forces come in and act on us in surprising ways. You might not be able to admit this cold truth but we can: You guys might break up. Sorry! Oh well, guess you two gotta talk about it now! We don\u2019t make the rules! <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating a home with someone is the merging of hearts and dreams, but it also involves the merging and sharing of assets. As we all know, nobody is guaranteed a happy-ever-after, which is why you should create a contingency plan for dealing with those shared assets if the worst happens (which we are <em>sure<\/em> it won\u2019t). <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/xUOwFU9fHBp2IYh54Y\/giphy.gif\" alt=\"\" \/><figcaption><em><a href=\"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/xUOwFU9fHBp2IYh54Y\/giphy.gif\">Giphy<\/a><\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>For couples who aren\u2019t married, a warning: In terms of legalities, buying a house together can get complicated. To cover your bases in the event of a split, you can draw up a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nolo.com\/legal-encyclopedia\/free-books\/living-together-book\/chapter6-9.html\">house ownership agreement<\/a> that outlines how you\u2019re going to title the property, how you\u2019ll split costs, and what you\u2019ll do in the event of a breakup. If you\u2019re married, and one of you is contributing more to the down payment, you should still pay attention \u2014 and potentially get something in writing \u2014 if you live in a <a href=\"https:\/\/statelaws.findlaw.com\/family-laws\/details-on-state-marital-property-laws.html\">community property state<\/a> like California, Nevada, or Washington. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether or not you end up buying a home right now \u2014 and hey, we have an entire guide that covers <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/home-guide\">everything you need to know about preparing to buy a home<\/a>, even if it\u2019s years away still \u2014 <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/talk-money-partner-before-marriage\/\">having these conversations<\/a> will assuredly result in you and your partner walking away with a more thorough understanding of how you both feel about&#8230;so many things. Talking about money will inevitably turn into a catalyst for talking about what you want and how you feel in every part of your life, and that\u2019s never a waste of time. Well beyond buying a home, getting in the habit of having open communication and always aiming to get aligned on goals, priorities, and expectations will benefit your relationship over and over, both in taking on your financial goals and the day-to-day experience of sharing your lives.<br><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>While you\u2019re letting your nesting fantasies run wild, make sure you and your partner are also being duly diligent by collaboratively answering these six important questions.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":129,"featured_media":10345,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[7231,7237],"tags":[6498,464,958,1206,1101,5647,6497],"yst_prominent_words":[6787,1751,6706,6784,3281,6729,6785,2781,6731,6782,6780,6788,1214,1216,6781,3288,6783,2771,6202,6786],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/10342"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/129"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=10342"}],"version-history":[{"count":7,"href":"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/10342\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":12037,"href":"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/10342\/revisions\/12037"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/10345"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=10342"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=10342"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=10342"},{"taxonomy":"yst_prominent_words","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/yst_prominent_words?post=10342"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
