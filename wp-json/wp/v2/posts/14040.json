She is also the co-founder and CEO of NakedPoppy, a clean beauty company, and serves on the boards of Novi and Skillshare.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She\u2019s consistently been a transformative force for consumer brands over the course of her career: she oversaw the rebranding of Amazon that led to the iconic Amazon smile logo, helped Opentable leapfrog over the competition by prioritizing core markets, and helped Upwork revolutionize the freelancing industry.&nbsp; Her writing has appeared in a variety of outlets including Business Insider, Entrepreneur, Fast Company, the Huffington Post, and VentureBeat.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She believes strongly in Wealthront\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wealthfronts-new-mission\/\">mission<\/a> and is excited to help even more people build secure and rewarding financial futures. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be more thrilled to join Wealthfront\u2019s Board of Directors to give more people the peace of mind that comes from knowing their finances are in good hands,\u201d said Jaleh. \u201cWealthfront has an exciting opportunity to not just be the best in their category but to become a brand people can&#8217;t live without.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>An exciting time&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Jaleh joins Wealthfront at an incredibly exciting time. Just last month, we delivered on our vision of Self-Driving Money\u2122 when we released new banking features that allow you to <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/you-can-now-use-wealthfronts-cash-account-to-automate-your-finances-from-end-to-end\/\">automate your finances from end to end<\/a>. We also launched new investing features that allow you to <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/you-can-now-use-wealthfront-to-build-and-automate-your-own-portfolio\/\">customize your investment portfolio<\/a> or build a new one from scratch. Next, we plan to offer even more investing options like individual stocks, a wider selection of ETFs, and cryptocurrency. All of these improvements are a way of putting decision-making power where it belongs: in your hands.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Wealthfront, we\u2019re building a financial system that favors people, not institutions. That means putting your interests first in everything we do and helping you build the financial future you want on your own terms. We\u2019re thrilled to partner with Jaleh, and we know her deep expertise will be crucial as we help even more people build financial lives they can be proud of.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Welcome to the board of directors, Jaleh!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Wealthfront is disrupting the traditional financial industry by using software to put our clients\u2019 interests first.
