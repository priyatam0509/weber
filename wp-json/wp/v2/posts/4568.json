In Silicon Valley, the most common type of windfall is a one-time liquidity event, like an IPO. It&#8217;s not unusual for an engineer or designer to work for years without a bonus or significant raise, only to receive a significant multiple of her annual salary when her company is acquired or goes public.<\/p>\n<p>Windfalls, however, can take many forms: a bonus, an inheritance, or even winning the lottery. It might be hard to imagine, but while this type of event is generally considered good news, it does bring with it a set of new financial challenges. As with many financial decisions, windfall events are often coupled with powerful emotions, and they are rarely the right ingredients for sound, long-term financial thinking.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/49ers_infographic_0813.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4576 alignleft\" style=\"border: 0px\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/49ers_infographic_0813.jpg\" alt=\"49ers_infographic_0813\" width=\"571\" height=\"716\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/49ers_infographic_0813.jpg 571w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/49ers_infographic_0813-399x500.jpg 399w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/49ers_infographic_0813-423x530.jpg 423w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 571px) 100vw, 571px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>There are a lot of different ways that millennials find success, and professional athletics is definitely one of the most well known.\u00a0 The average NFL player has a career of 5-7 years, and while their income during those years is extremely high they need to plan for the future beyond their playing career.<\/p>\n<p>Ronnie Lott, member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame and four-time Super Bowl Champion, explains, \u201cThe NFL is an unbelievable experience for any young athlete. They make a lifetime&#8217;s worth of money in a short time period, but they need help planning for the long term. I think Wealthfront can be a huge part of the solution.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>At Wealthfront, we believe everyone deserves sophisticated financial advice.<\/p>\n<h2>An Automated Investment Service for Everyone<\/h2>\n<p>2014 has been a record-breaking year for Wealthfront, as millennial investors have overwhelmingly made us the largest and fastest-growing automated investment service in the country.
