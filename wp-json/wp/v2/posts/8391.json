As we explained in\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/following-rules\/\">last month\u2019s blog post<\/a>, when it comes to investing we look for time-tested, academically proven, rules-based strategies that can be implemented through software. That focus led us to build PassivePlus\u00ae, our signature suite of rules-based investment strategies that includes Tax-Loss Harvesting, Stock-level Tax-Loss Harvesting, and Smart Beta. Fortunately we\u2019re not done building.<\/p>\n<p>Today we\u2019re excited to introduce our newest PassivePlus strategy,\u00a0<strong>Risk Parity<\/strong>. Risk Parity aims to increase your risk-adjusted returns in a wide range of market environments through an enhanced asset allocation strategy.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>\u00a0Exclusive Company<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The empirical underpinning for Risk Parity has existed in academic literature since the 1970s.<sup>1\u00a0<\/sup><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bridgewater_Associates\">Bridgewater Associates<\/a>, the world\u2019s largest hedge fund, first offered its risk parity strategy through its All Weather Fund to institutional investors (endowments, pensions, life insurance companies, etc.) more than 20 years later in 1996 due to the operational challenges of executing the strategy.<\/p>\n<p>We would love to add Bridgewater\u2019s risk parity fund to our clients\u2019 portfolios, but unfortunately they require a $100 million account minimum. So our research PhDs and engineers spent the past year effectively replicating Bridgewater\u2019s risk parity strategy, delivering our version exclusively through software. This new strategy will be available as part of a diversified portfolio for our clients with taxable investment accounts starting at $100,000.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Off to the Races<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The key benefit of Risk Parity is the way it balances the risk of an investment portfolio. Wealthfront\u2019s Chief Investment Officer Burt Malkiel offers an effective analogy to illustrate this point:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cImagine you\u2019re at a horse racing track. There are long-shot horses (considered by most to be unlikely to win, but with the largest winning payout), horses that are middle of the pack, and favorites (considered most likely to win, but with smaller winning payouts). What is your optimal betting strategy? Sure, the significant payoff of the long-shots is enticing enough to lure some into throwing their money at them, but a more prudent bet is the favorite. Why? Well, it turns out that over time if you consistently bet the long-shots you lose 40% the amount of your bet to pay taxes and operational expenses since the track takes 20% of each bet. However, over time, if you stuck with betting the favorites, you\u2019d only lose about 5% of your bet over time. Risk Parity aims to give you the probability of the favorites with potentially the larger payoff of the long-shot.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In the world of asset classes, there are also favorites and long-shots. A favorite is an asset class with relatively low risk, but also lower expected returns (e.g. bonds). Other asset classes, such as the stocks, have higher expected returns, but also higher risk. Risk Parity aims increase your risk-adjusted returns in a wide range of market environments through an enhanced asset allocation strategy.\u00a0 If you want to dig in more to how we do this, please see our\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/support.wealthfront.com\/hc\/en-us\/sections\/360000020823-Risk-Parity\">Help Center section on Risk Parity<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Minor Cost, Major Value <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Risk Parity is the first investment product we\u2019ve built that will increase your portfolio\u2019s average annual expense ratio. This was driven by our need to structure our Risk Parity implementation as a mutual fund in order to preserve the value we offer through our Tax-Loss-Harvesting and Portfolio Line of Credit. Just as the ETFs we use have an associated expense ratio, the Wealthfront Risk Parity Fund has an expense ratio of 0.25%. Fortunately your weighted average annual expense ratio will only increase by 0.03%.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to us to be transparent about what we charge to invest your money. Risk Parity is designed to increase your long term net-of-fees, after-tax, risk-adjusted returns, but you have a two-week period to opt out if you don\u2019t want to use the strategy for any reason.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Wealthfront Standard<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>At Wealthfront we\u2019re focused on maximizing your financial fitness so you can focus on what\u2019s most important: living your life. So when it comes to adding any new service, we have simple criteria:\u00a0 it must deliver significant value; have lower fees than the alternatives; and provide access to something you can\u2019t get anywhere else. Like our other PassivePlus strategies, Risk Parity checks all three important boxes. We can\u2019t wait for you to start benefiting from this time-tested, academically proven, rules-based strategy.<\/p>\n<p><sup>1<\/sup>\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/citeseerx.ist.psu.edu\/viewdoc\/download?doi=10.1.1.665.9887&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf.\">Black, Jensen and Scholes<\/a> (1972) shows that low (high) beta stocks outperform (underperform) the general market on a risk-adjusted basis, suggesting that leveraged exposure to low beta stocks have the potential to outperform investing in high beta stocks.
