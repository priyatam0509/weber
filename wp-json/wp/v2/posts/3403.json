At the same time, we\u2019re starting to see the media raise the question that&#8217;s been on my mind lately: <em>Why do traditional advisors charge so much when the underlying investment products (the ETFs) are getting cheaper and cheaper?<\/em><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/jeff_rosenberger1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-3405 alignleft\" title=\"Jeff Rosenberger, PhD, Wealthfront's Director of Research\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/jeff_rosenberger1.png\" alt=\"Jeff Rosenberger, PhD, Wealthfront's Director of Research\" width=\"150\" height=\"215\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Two weeks ago, <a title=\"Vanguard announces index changes\" href=\"https:\/\/personal.vanguard.com\/us\/insights\/article\/fund-announcement-10022012\" target=\"_blank\">Vanguard announced<\/a> it will change the indexes it uses for 22 of its index funds and ETFs. For instance, it will now use FTSE for international indexes in place of its previous index provider, MSCI.<\/p>\n<p>Most people don\u2019t realize the publishers of indexes charge fund managers like Vanguard a fee to use their indexes. License fees can <a title=\"Chicago Tribune: U.S. index providers brace for price war\" href=\"http:\/\/www.chicagotribune.com\/business\/sns-rt-us-msci-vanguard-providersbre8960hp-20121007,0,2930640.story\" target=\"_blank\">range from 0.02% to 0.30% of an index fund\u2019s assets<\/a>. For Vanguard, the license fee probably represents its largest cost. By moving to new but still appropriate indexes, Vanguard is able to significantly lower its costs. As essentially a not-for-profit company (like a mutual savings bank, Vanguard is owned by the investors in its funds, not by shareholders), it can then pass along all of its savings to investors, thereby maintaining its role as cost leader.<\/p>\n<p>On a side note, it was notable to us that Vanguard is able to make this switch without triggering capital gains taxes for its clients, because it\u2019s been using tax-loss harvesting (TLH) within their ETFs. The company will reallocate $10B in its funds (see this article from <a title=\"Bloomberg: Toyota Prius Dominates California as No. 1 Model Weil: Rajat Gupta\u2019s Friends in High Places 1:13 Everyone's a Cameraman: A Dip Into the GoPro Craze Romney\u2019s Rates Seen Spurring Growth Too Little Too Late 2:00 Frenetic Nike Ad Tops Expert List of 2012's Best Smith Quit Goldman After \u2018Unrealistic\u2019 Pitch for $1 Million Toyota Prius Dominates California as No. 1 Model Weil: Rajat Gupta\u2019s Friends in High Places 1:13 Everyone's a Cameraman: A Dip Into the GoPro Craze Romney\u2019s Rates Seen Spurring Growth Too Little Too Late 2:00 Frenetic Nike Ad Tops Expert List of 2012's Best Smith Quit Goldman After \u2018Unrealistic\u2019 Pitch for $1 Million Vanguard Switch to FTSE May Prompt Selling in South Korea Stocks\" href=\"http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/2012-10-03\/vanguard-switch-to-ftse-may-prompt-selling-in-south-korea-stocks.html\" target=\"_blank\">Bloomberg<\/a> and this <a title=\"Rick Ferri: Vanguard Does the CRSP Shuffle\" href=\"http:\/\/www.rickferri.com\/blog\/investments\/vanguard-does-the-crsp-shuffle\/\" target=\"_blank\">piece<\/a> by investment columnist Rick Ferri for more details about the changes and how they\u2019ve affected the market). Vanguard expects basically no capital gains distributions from the transition, because it is managing the process over six months and using TLH. Wealthfront is now offering <a title=\"Wealthfront's tax-loss harvesting service\" href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/tax-loss-harvesting\" target=\"_blank\">automated, continuous TLH<\/a> \u2013 historically available only to institutions and clients with at least $10-$20 million in their portfolios \u2013 to our clients with accounts of $100,000 or more.<\/p>\n<h2>BlackRock\u2019s News<\/h2>\n<p>On the heels of Vanguard\u2019s announcement, BlackRock, whose iShares unit is the largest ETF provider, said <a title=\"Reuters: BlackRock slashes some ETF fees, offers cheaper options\" href=\"http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/2012\/10\/15\/us-blackrock-etffees-idUSBRE89E1LM20121015\" target=\"_blank\">it is slashing fees on six of its iShares exchange-traded funds<\/a> and introducing four new ETFs. BlackRock is responding to intense competition in the ETF market, which is basically, for fund companies, the best growth opportunity out there. BlackRock has 41% of the market, though its share has declined from 48% in 2009. Vanguard, the third-largest ETF provider behind State Street Global Advisors, has seen its market share increase to 18% from 12% during the same period. State Street&#8217;s market share has remained flat at about 25%, according to <em>The<\/em> <em>Wall Street Journal<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Both company\u2019s moves are good news for investors, as earlier developments in the <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/compare-schwab-and-vanguard-etfs-price-war\/\">ETF price wars<\/a> have been, too.<\/p>\n<p>Competition is driving down the costs of ETFs, so that many fees are below 0.15%, and some are below 0.10%. On the average portfolio chosen by Wealthfront for its clients, the ETF fees are 0.14%.<\/p>\n<p>Wealthfront chooses the ETFs for its client portfolios based on fees, tracking error and liquidity, as you can see from our plan page. We\u2019re carefully examining the iShares cuts to see if it makes sense to replace any of our currently recommended ETFs.<\/p>\n<h2>Whack-A-Mole<\/h2>\n<p>The financial services industry is like a whack-a-mole game: when costs fall in one place, they rise in another. While costs continue to fall on the ETFs themselves, some advisors are marketing new ways of combining ETFs, adding new fees for complexities that are of questionable value.<\/p>\n<p>Last weekend, Jason Zweig of <em>The Wall Street Journal<\/em> <a title=\"Wall Street Journal: When Cheap Funds Cost Too Much\" href=\"http:\/\/online.wsj.com\/article\/SB10000872396390444657804578050501097576018.html#project%3DETF1013%26articleTabs%3Darticle\" target=\"_blank\">wrote<\/a>:<\/p>\n<p><em>Exchange-traded funds have quickly become one of the cheapest and simplest investing tools in the world.
