\u00a0In a world with 100 percent indexing, who would trade from stock to stock to ensure that the market was efficient? \u00a0The stock market does need some active traders who analyze and act on new information so that stocks are efficiently priced and sufficiently liquid for investors to be able to buy and sell. \u00a0Active traders play a positive role in determining security prices and in turn how capital is allocated.<\/p>\n<p>Active managers are incentivized to perform this function by charging substantial management fees. \u00a0They will continue to market their services with the claim that they have above-average insights that enable them to beat the market even though, unlike in Garrison Keillor\u2019s mythical Lake Wobegon, they cannot all achieve above-average market returns. \u00a0And even if the proportion of active managers shrinks to as little as 10 or 5 percent of the total, there would still be more than enough of them to make prices reflect information. \u00a0We have far too much active management today, not too little.<\/p>\n<p>But as a thought experiment, suppose everybody did index and individual stocks did not reflect new information? \u00a0Suppose a drug company develops a new cancer drug that promises to double the company\u2019s sales and earnings but that the price of their shares does not increase to reflect the news. \u00a0In our capitalist system it is inconceivable that some trader or hedge fund would not emerge to bid up the price of the stock and profit from the mispricing. \u00a0In a free-market system we can expect that advantageous arbitrage opportunities are exploited by profit-seeking market participants no matter how many investors index.<\/p>\n<p>To be sure, index investors are free riders. \u00a0They do receive the benefits that result from active trading without bearing the costs. \u00a0But free riding on price signals provided by others is hardly a flaw of the capitalist system; it is an essential feature of that system. \u00a0In a free-market economy we all benefit from relying on a set of market prices that are determined by others.<\/p>\n<p>Index funds have been of enormous benefit for individual investors. \u00a0Competition has driven the cost of broad-based index funds very close to zero. \u00a0Individuals can now save for retirement far more efficiently than before.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; line-height: 12px;\"><strong>Disclosure<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; line-height: 12px;\"><br \/>\nNothing in this article should be construed as tax advice, a solicitation or offer, or recommendation, to buy or sell any security.
