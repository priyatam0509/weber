Maybe you already have a little one in your favorite school&#8217;s gear watching the big games with you. You dream of them following in your footsteps, but you need to know how much it\u2019s going to cost, whether it&#8217;s\u00a05, 10, or 15 years down the road. Wealthfront helps you explore your options by giving you a complete and total cost estimate based on when they will be ready to attend.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter \" src=\"https:\/\/cdn.wealthfront.com\/public.email.images\/collegerelaunch_blog_school_selection.gif\" width=\"251\" height=\"544\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Path, our financial planning engine, uses data from the National Center of Education Statistics (<a href=\"https:\/\/nces.ed.gov\/ipeds\/\">IPEDS<\/a>) and incorporates inflation estimates to project college costs such as tuition, room and board, books, etc. and how much financial aid you can expect across any university or college in the U.S.<\/p>\n<p>And even if you&#8217;re a few years away from having kids, you can still get a head start.

Once you\u2019ve explored all options and are ready to make a plan, Wealthfront gives you an accurate and complete picture of those future costs and helps you easily kickstart a savings plan that also takes into account your other goals.<\/p>\n<p>You can explore how saving a few hundred dollars more a month impacts how much you can afford to cover and how much financial aid you can expect. You may even find that saving a little extra doesn\u2019t impact how much financial aid you\u2019re eligible for. These are the nuances we help guide you through.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn.wealthfront.com\/public.email.images\/collegerelaunch_blog_savings_slider.gif\" width=\"250\" height=\"542\" \/><\/p>\n<p>When you\u2019re ready to save, there\u2019s a special investment account to help you: the <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wealthfront-529-college-savings-plan\/\">Wealthfront 529 College Savings Plan<\/a>\u00a0. It&#8217;s a tax-advantaged investment account specifically designed to help you grow your savings for educational expenses. With the Wealthfront 529 account your savings benefit from the power of compounding, or as we like to call it \u2018the eighth wonder of the world\u2019.

But Also, You<\/h3>\n<p>Paying for your child&#8217;s college tuition might be your top priority, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you shouldn&#8217;t focus on your other important goals. Wealthfront allows you to explore how new or potential financial goals impact your life so you can understand the trade-offs you may have to make. Even if you don&#8217;t have kids yet, you can still see how a future child&#8217;s college costs can impact when you can retire and how much you can spend in retirement.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter \" src=\"https:\/\/cdn.wealthfront.com\/public.email.images\/collegerelaunch_blog_savings_plan.gif\" width=\"250\" height=\"542\" \/><\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ll make recommendations on which account you should save into to help you reach your goals.
