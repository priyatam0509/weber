The fiduciary duty, in short, is a duty to act in the best interests of customers.\u00a0 Although progress has been made, this common sense proposal still faces an uphill battle thanks to opposition from a relatively small segment of the broker-dealer community and their anti-regulatory allies at the Commission and on the Hill.\u00a0 The question for investors is, \u201cWhy should you care?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>If you are like most investors, you don\u2019t know whether your financial advisor is a broker, an investment advisor, or a little bit of both.\u00a0 You don\u2019t know that investment advisors are supposed to act in their customers\u2019 best interests, but brokers don\u2019t have to, under their regulatory guidelines.\u00a0 And, trusting in your advisors\u2019 expertise and integrity, you generally do exactly what he recommends, without researching or second-guessing those recommendations.\u00a0 In short, you act as if your broker is required to act in your best interests even though he is not.<\/p>\n<h2>Returns that might have been yours<\/h2>\n<p>But what\u2019s the harm?\u00a0 It\u2019s not as if brokers aren\u2019t regulated.\u00a0 And, while brokers may not have a fiduciary duty to their customers, they do have to make \u201csuitable\u201d recommendations.\u00a0 The point, of course, is that the difference between what\u2019s suitable and what\u2019s best for you could mean money in your pocket.<\/p>\n<p>Imagine, for example, that you are investing $25,000 toward your retirement savings, and your broker is trying to decide between two large cap value funds, the American Funds\u2019 American Mutual Fund (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.americanfunds.com\/funds\/details.htm?fundNumber=42\">AMRMX<\/a>) or Federated\u2019s Clover Value Fund (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.federatedinvestors.com\/FII\/mutualfunds\/details\/overview.do?fundshareid=11371&amp;basketid=19644\">VFCAX<\/a>).\u00a0 Assuming a 20-year holding period and an 8% gross return, and taking into account the two funds&#8217; fees\/expenses and sales charges, you\u2019d have a little over $97,500 at the end of that period if your broker chose the American Funds option, compared with just over $86,500 for the higher-cost Federated option.<a href=\"#_ftn1\">[1]<\/a> That $11,000 difference represents money most investors can\u2019t afford to leave on the table.\u00a0 On an investment of $100,000, the difference between the two options rises to roughly $45,000.<\/p>\n<p>Under the current standards, either of these funds would be considered suitable, and the broker would be free to base his choice on the one that pays him most.\u00a0 Under a fiduciary duty, the broker would have to recommend the fund he thinks is best for you, and if one of the funds paid him a higher commission, he\u2019d have to warn you in advance of that incentive and ignore the incentive when making his recommendation.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, imposing a fiduciary duty doesn\u2019t guarantee that the broker will always end up making the best choice for you.\u00a0 The fund that looks like it would be the better option could end up hitting a run of bad luck.\u00a0 But it does mean the broker can\u2019t choose to ignore factors \u2013 like fund costs or long-term risk-adjusted performance record or the quality of the match between the fund\u2019s investment strategy and your investment needs \u2013 in favor of her own economic interests.\u00a0 Costs are a particularly important factor when making this comparison, since funds that pay the broker more are generally going to take that money out of the investor\u2019s pocket.\u00a0 And, as research has shown, keeping costs low is the best predictor of investor success.<\/p>\n<h2>Massive transfer of money<\/h2>\n<p>The differences can be even more dramatic when you leave the relatively cost competitive world of mutual funds and move into variable annuities.\u00a0 While many <a title=\"Liz Pulliam Weston &quot;The Worst Retirement Investment You Can Make&quot;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.jcgower.com\/media\/The$20Worst$20Retirement$20Investment$20You$20Can$20Make.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">personal finance writers<\/a> believe the cost of variable annuities almost always outweighs their benefits, their high commissions make them popular among a certain group of brokers who market their services to middle class and rural investors.\u00a0 One analyst <a title=\"Scott Burns for AssetBuilder &quot;Variable Annuity Watch, 2008&quot;\" href=\"http:\/\/assetbuilder.com\/blogs\/scott_burns\/archive\/2008\/08\/22\/variable-annuity-watch-2008.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">estimates<\/a> that variable annuities transfer approximately $25.6 billion a year \u201cof spendable investment returns\u201d from vulnerable investors to these salesmen.<\/p>\n<p>With that much money on the table, it should come as no surprise that these same variable-annuity-selling broker-dealers are among the most passionate opponents of the fiduciary standard.\u00a0 After all, under a fiduciary duty they\u2019d have to forego the high payouts from sales of variable annuities if the investor would be better off in a different investment product or using a different investment strategy.\u00a0 At the very least, they couldn\u2019t load up the annuities they sell with a lot of features that increase their own payday without offering fair returns for the investor.\u00a0 Ultimately, if product sponsors had to compete by offering features that benefit the customer, instead of competing by offering more generous compensation to brokers, the benefits of a fiduciary duty could really add up.<\/p>\n<p>My point is not that the broker-dealer business model has no redeeming features.\u00a0 Many investors prefer to pay for investment recommendations through commissions on a transaction-by-transaction basis.\u00a0 Others simply can\u2019t afford or don\u2019t have sufficient assets to justify the higher and\/or ongoing fees that often accompany comprehensive financial planning or on-going portfolio management.\u00a0 For these investors, the SEC proposal offers the best of both worlds.\u00a0 It preserves the ability of brokers to charge commissions and offer transaction-based recommendations, but it requires them to disclose and \u2013 even more important \u2013 appropriately manage those conflicts of interest.\u00a0 And it requires them to make recommendations that put the customer\u2019s interests first.\u00a0 It is a proposal that deserves investors\u2019 enthusiastic support.<\/p>\n<p>If you believe brokers should have to act in their customers\u2019 best interests, let the SEC know.\u00a0 You can send them an email to <a href=\"mailto:rule-comments@sec.gov\">rule-comments@sec.gov<\/a> (include File Number 4-606 in the subject line).\u00a0 And, while you\u2019re at it, send a copy to your <a
