Less than a month later \u2014 after over $1 billion in deposits \u2014 we bumped the APY up to 2.29%. Today, we\u2019ve earned our clients over $5 million in interest, and we\u2019re already back at it: <strong>our Wealthfront Cash Account now has an APY of 2.51% \u2014 the highest rate on the market*<\/strong>. That\u2019s 0.26% more than Marcus Savings, 0.31% more than Ally Savings, and 0.51% more than Capital One 360*. It still comes with the same insurance protection that only Wealthfront offers: up to $1 million in FDIC coverage. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/FZR87px04clX4yQ4LEgrYewMZE8p2S6i4crayYjYP21_60SSwSeh38DkxgBWVmFBcwEw0IYDBfw4uKRt5-2soVSfm927AvAT0YZPMm9SAQm_llsZfuGZKyVseycJD8JXn9M3pcoy\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Source: <\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bankrate.com\"><em>www.bankrate.com<\/em><\/a><em>, as of May 28, 2019<\/em><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not that we need to spell it out for you, but a higher APY is amazing news for Wealthfront clients. Whether you\u2019re saving for your emergency fund, stashing away cash before you invest it, or building up the money you need for your next down payment, you\u2019ll now earn even more on your extra cash to reach your goals faster. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why do we keep raising the APY on our cash account? It\u2019s simple \u2014 passing more on to our clients is in our company DNA. <strong>We fundamentally believe that your money should be making money for <\/strong><strong><em>you<\/em><\/strong><strong>, not your bank, and we\u2019ve built our entire business around this belief.<\/strong> As our service scales, we benefit from cost savings that we\u2019ll <em>always<\/em> pass on to you. When rates improve, that\u2019s yours too. You\u2019ve trusted us with over $1 billion dollars, which is the kind of growth that lets us turn the cash karma back around to you. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your old bank just won\u2019t do this. The 2.51% APY on our cash accounts might seem like just a nice thing, but it\u2019s so much bigger than that \u2014 it\u2019s symptomatic of everything that makes Wealthfront more transparent and client-driven. In the last quarter of 2018 alone, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-usa-banks-results\/u-s-banks-record-59-1-billion-in-profits-in-fourth-quarter-of-2018-idUSKCN1QA2LK\">U.S. banks made over $59 billion in profits<\/a> while your cash sat around in their accounts earning you next to nothing. The Wealthfront business model puts your interests first. That\u2019s just not how traditional banks are built. What does your bank have that we <em>won\u2019t <\/em>give you? Overdraft fees, account maintenance fees, and confusing services that force you to go into a branch or dial a call center. We doubt you\u2019ll miss them.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Worried this news comes with some hidden downside? (It\u2019s okay, we can\u2019t blame you for not trusting financial institutions. You\u2019ve seen their dark side.) Don\u2019t sweat it \u2014 everything you love about your Wealthfront Cash Account is still there: up to $1M FDIC insurance, unlimited free transfers, and no fees. We\u2019re here with purely good news today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is just the starting line for us. There are so many game-changing developments to come for our cash account. Next up on our roadmap: effortless transfers between your Wealthfront accounts, auto bill pay, direct deposit, and debit\/ATM cards.<strong> <\/strong>We\u2019ve heard what you want, we\u2019ve imagined an integrated ecosystem of investment and cash accounts that gives it to you, and that\u2019s become the true north we\u2019re building toward every day.
