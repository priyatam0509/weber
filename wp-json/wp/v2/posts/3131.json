Of course, it\u2019s hard for buyers to beware in such a <a title=\"Upfront Blog on investment disclosures\" href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/call-bullshit-disclosures-dont-work\/\" target=\"_blank\">complicated business with so little transparency<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Every few years, journalists and regulators rediscover the problem with Wall Street. In a follow up story to the JPMorgan piece, <a title=\"NY Times on Wall Street ethics\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2012\/07\/07\/your-money\/beware-of-fancy-financial-adviser-titles.html?_r=3&amp;src=me&amp;ref=general\" target=\"_blank\">A Fancy Financial Title Does Not Ensure High Standards<\/a>, Tara Siegel Barnard wrote about the latest efforts in Washington, D.C., to require Wall Street brokers to act in their clients\u2019 best interests.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTwo years ago,\u201d she wrote, \u201cthe Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law gave the Securities and Exchange Commission the authority to write rules that would require brokers to adhere to the same standard as advisers \u2014 a standard known as \u2018fiduciary duty\u2019 \u2014 but the law stopped short of requiring that the rules be written. Not surprisingly, the S.E.C. has yet to write <a title=\"NY Times on historic SEC regulation changes\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2010\/02\/16\/business\/16adviserside.html?_r=1&amp;ref=business\" target=\"_blank\">the rules<\/a>.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>(Wealthfront, as a registered investment advisor, is a fiduciary).<\/p>\n<p>Our two cents? Real change is coming about, but slowly, as educated consumers find market-based solutions. It\u2019s taken decades, but Vanguard, with its <a title=\"Upfront Blog on Schwab vs Vanguard\" href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/compare-schwab-and-vanguard-etfs-price-war\/\" target=\"_blank\">super-low-fee approach and its unique corporate structure<\/a>, is now one of the largest mutual fund companies. A growing number of brokers are going independent, so they aren\u2019t obliged to sell funds owned by their parent companies. And there are more low-fee online options, like <a title=\"Wealthfront.com\" href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Wealthfront<\/a> and others.<\/p>\n<p>One of the experts quoted in Ms. Seigel Barnard\u2019s story suggested that if you want to test your brokerage\u2019s ethics, call the firm and ask to be put into a no-load Vanguard fund.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf you were to call up Merrill, can you get them to sell you and put you into a no-load Vanguard fund?\u201d said <a title=\"Bio: John C.
