First of all, you\u2019re sick of living in rentals. You want to design your dream bathroom, cover your patio in plants, paint the walls whatever color you want, and finally \u2014 <em>finally<\/em>! \u2014 get a dog. And that\u2019s not even to mention how incongruous renting is with your overall money mindset. You\u2019ve been saving, you\u2019ve got a solid down payment ready to go, you\u2019ve picked a neighborhood where properties are overwhelmingly likely to appreciate over time. It\u2019s go time \u2014 and you\u2019re completely undaunted by the idea of buying property as a single individual. You\u2019re not only longing for a spot to call your own, you also can\u2019t find any good reason to wait for a partner to start investing in your future now. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019re not alone. Between <a href=\"https:\/\/www.urban.org\/sites\/default\/files\/publication\/84206\/2000930-Women-Are-Better-Than-Men-At-Paying-Their-Mortgages.pdf\">2004 and 2014<\/a>, single borrowers accounted for just over half of all mortgages in the United States. And in 2017, single women were a force to be reckoned with, comprising nearly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nar.realtor\/sites\/default\/files\/documents\/2017-profile-of-home-buyers-and-sellers-11-20-2017.pdf\">one-fifth of all home buyers<\/a>. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ready to take the plunge? Here are six things to know before buying a house by yourself. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1. It\u2019s a waiting game.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Entering into home ownership is like falling asleep: It happens slowly and then all at once. (Okay, fine, maybe that\u2019s not exactly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/work\/quotes\/16827462-the-fault-in-our-stars\">how the quote goes<\/a>.) Wealthfront has you covered on this front: We put together a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/home-guide\">guide that goes through everything<\/a> \u2014 seriously, <em>everything <\/em>\u2014 you could need to know about buying a home, whether you\u2019re aiming to do financial housekeeping for a purchase still years down the road or arming yourself with all the details about what it takes to buy a home, customized according to where you are, how much you make, and what you want.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter when you decide to finally go for it, buying a home is never as easy as you imagine it will be when you dive in, nor will it happen as quickly as you assume it will. These two truths are even starker when you\u2019re buying a place by yourself. So prepare to channel your inner kindergarten teacher and stretch your patience to its limits. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your need for greater patience doesn\u2019t begin with your search for the perfect property. Even getting into a position to start seriously house-hunting will go more slowly when you\u2019re going it alone. Again, this is where <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/home-planning\">Wealthfront\u2019s free planning feature<\/a> comes in. We factor in all the essential details \u2014 your income, net worth, credit score, and debt-to-income ratio \u2014 to tell you how much you can afford, how much you should put down, and what budget range would be most doable without derailing your other goals. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-3 is-cropped\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"245\" height=\"530\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/8-2-245x530.png\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"10398\" data-link=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/?attachment_id=10398\" class=\"wp-image-10398\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/8-2-245x530.png 245w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/8-2-231x500.png 231w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/8-2.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 245px) 100vw, 245px\" \/><\/figure><\/li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"245\" height=\"530\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/9-1-245x530.png\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"10399\" data-link=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/?attachment_id=10399\" class=\"wp-image-10399\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/9-1-245x530.png 245w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/9-1-231x500.png 231w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/9-1.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 245px) 100vw, 245px\" \/><\/figure><\/li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"245\" height=\"530\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/10-1-245x530.png\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"10400\" data-link=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/?attachment_id=10400\" class=\"wp-image-10400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/10-1-245x530.png 245w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/10-1-231x500.png 231w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/10-1.png 750w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 245px) 100vw, 245px\" \/><\/figure><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Unless you\u2019re <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/equity-ipo-guide\/managing-windfall\/\">pulling from a windfall<\/a>, it\u2019s likely going to take you longer to save up for a down payment. If this is the grueling stage you\u2019re currently in (our thoughts are with you, savings soldier) and you haven\u2019t done so already, start funneling money into a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/cash\">high-yield cash account<\/a> (while also making sure you\u2019re continuing to pay off debt and throw money down the road toward retirement \u2014&nbsp;single life is a blast, right?). In total, you should strive to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/home-guide#down-payment\">save at least 20% of the home\u2019s purchase price<\/a>, both to attract lenders and avoid paying private mortgage insurance (PMI). <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. Your finances need to be as strong as possible<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While you can definitely lean heavily on Wealthfront to map out your dream future, including driving toward a home-buying goal, if you want to check our math \u2014 you won\u2019t have Wealthfront\u2019s data-driven projections though! \u2014 here are the key numbers you need to focus on to make yourself as appealing as possible to prospective lenders: your debt-to-income ratio (DTI) and credit scores. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lenders look at both your \u201cfront-end\u201d and \u201cback-end\u201d DTI. The front end compares your projected monthly housing expenses (mortgage plus insurance plus taxes) to your gross monthly income. The back end works the same way, except it factors in all other debts too.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to taking longer to save the cash you need, single borrowers sometimes struggle to find lenders willing to work with them. Yes, some of this is steeped in antiquated biases against single people. And yes, some of it is a case of hard numbers \u2014 it\u2019s objectively harder to hit a favorable DTI when you\u2019re working with one income instead of two. Finding the right lender as a solo home buyer means having patience and the shiniest finances you can pull off. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How does this look in real life? Let\u2019s say this is what you\u2019ve got coming in and out each month: <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Gross income: $6,000<\/li><li>Rent: $2,000<\/li><li>Student loan: $500<\/li><li>Auto loan: $200<\/li><li>Credit card debt: $300<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In this situation, your front-end DTI would be 33% ($2,000\/$6,000), and your back-end DTI would be 50% ($3,000\/$6,000). Most lenders are looking for a front-end DTI below 28% and a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/home-guide#all-in-costs\">back-end below 33%<\/a>. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if your DTI is high, as in the example above, it may be difficult not only to get a loan to buy a home, but it could also be taxing to afford your mortgage payments. If you want to slide into a friendlier DTI range before purchasing a house, focus on <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/financial-health-debt\/\">paying off debt<\/a> and increasing your income. We know it\u2019s not <em>easy<\/em>, but it <em>is <\/em>that simple. Getting into a better financial position before taking on home buying isn\u2019t that complicated. It\u2019s just hard and, again, requires patience (which is understandably in short supply when you\u2019re waiting to get a dog).<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your DTI is already rock solid \u2014 hey, look at you! \u2014 the next step is to check your credit. You can get <a href=\"http:\/\/annualcreditreport.com\">one free credit report<\/a> per year, per bureau, and you should review each to make sure it\u2019s free of errors. Then you should grab one of your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.creditkarma.com\">free FICO scores<\/a>. The higher your scores, the better your chances of qualifying for a mortgage,&nbsp;and the lower your interest rates may be. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3. The government might be your secret weapon.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAlone\u201d is a relative term when it comes to buying a home. Are your finances looking \u2014 <em>ahem<\/em> \u2014 less shiny than you\u2019d ideally like them to be, or have you already been denied by a handful of lenders? Your best ally might be the federal government. &nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) offers <a href=\"https:\/\/www.consumerfinance.gov\/owning-a-home\/loan-options\/fha-loans\/\">home loans<\/a> to buyers who have a down payment of at least 3.5% and credit scores of at least 580. (If your credit scores fall below that, you can still get a loan, but you\u2019ll need a down payment of at least 10%.) Note: Because they require <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hsh.com\/calc-pmionly.html\">mortgage insurance<\/a>, FHA loans can end up costing more over their lifetimes. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before making any decisions, there are other government resources worth taking advantage of: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.consumerfinance.gov\/find-a-housing-counselor\/\">Speak to a counselor<\/a> approved by the U.S. Department for Housing and Urban Development, and scour the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.consumerfinance.gov\/owning-a-home\/\">housing section<\/a> of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2019s website. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>4. You shouldn\u2019t actually do this alone.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Being an independent and self-determined person isn\u2019t about doing everything yourself \u2014 it\u2019s about masterfully assembling the best team of resources and people to put your plan into action. When it comes to buying a home (or really pulling off any big financial goal), think of yourself less like a one-man band and more like the conductor of an orchestra. Just because your name is the only one going on the deed, that doesn\u2019t mean you need to complete the home-buying process alone. It\u2019s important to insulate yourself with as much support as you can, both functionally and morally (again, this is a stressful and patience-testing process). <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given that so much of what we do at Wealthfront is centered around helping you prepare, save, and invest for the future you want and make the smartest possible moves around big expenses, and we\u2019re particularly driven to give our clients the info and support they need to plan for buying a home. When you want to look at different home-buying scenarios \u2014 How does your budget change if you move jobs or cities? How much of a down payment is ideal for your situation? What trade-offs can you make to your overall financial plan to make buying a home possible <em>and <\/em>keep it from holding you back with other plans? \u2014 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/home-planning\">we extremely have your back<\/a>. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also on your dream team, you\u2019ll want a realtor who understands your needs (and respects your budget) and a mortgage lender who will work hard to get you the best rates. You\u2019ll also need a few family members or friends who can come with you to see a million places, help you weigh the importance of vaulted ceilings versus a sweet view, and talk you down when you start losing it, which you will (probably more than once). You might also need a good bartender&#8230;or therapist&#8230;or a therapist who will drink with you. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5. It\u2019s going to cost more than you think.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Although HGTV makes it all look like fun and games, the truth is houses are expensive. Closing costs can add an additional 4% to your home\u2019s purchase price, and unexpected repairs can hardly even be called \u201cunexpected\u201d \u2014 they\u2019re going to happen. Again, Wealthfront\u2019s home planning feature will help you play with all the numbers and see what\u2019s possible. We pulled the cover off the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/home-guide#all-in-costs\"><em>actual <\/em>costs of buying a home<\/a> and include them in them when cooking up the projections and recommendations you\u2019ll see in our free planning feature.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"680\" height=\"461\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Screen-Shot-2019-05-08-at-9.27.27-AM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10397\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Screen-Shot-2019-05-08-at-9.27.27-AM.png 680w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/Screen-Shot-2019-05-08-at-9.27.27-AM-640x434.png 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another tip: To steel yourself against the as-yet-unknown costs associated with becoming a homeowner, create a \u201cnew home emergency fund\u201d that equates to 1%\u20133% of the house\u2019s total value. Do this before you even make an offer. There\u2019s no bigger bummer than draining your resources to procure a home you love and then immediately having to put the entire project on pause while you save up the money you need to actually make the place livable. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>6. Spoiler: You can plan for the future, but you can\u2019t predict it.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>People who are obsessed with mindful financial planning (hello, we relate) like to try to predict the future, while at the same time knowing that the most astute people are the ones who routinely build flexibility into their plans. Because everything is subject to change at any time. That\u2019s true of market conditions, and it\u2019s true of your life and priorities. In a few years, you might get a dream job that moves you to another city. You might partner up or have a kid. You might stop wearing shoes and start doing Reiki in Bali. Making space for what you can\u2019t currently see coming is the most critical piece of a strong financial future plan.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So before signing on the dotted line, think about how this house will fit into your future \u2014 not just the one you think is most likely to unfold, but the countless other future lives that <em>might <\/em>transpire. Sure, you can\u2019t make every big purchase with every future scenario in mind, but if you can buy a home that advantages you in a number of different hypothetical futures, you\u2019ve really killed it. Is this place located in an up-and-coming neighborhood where it\u2019s likely to have excellent resale value? Could you potentially generate passive income on your house by renting it out while you&#8217;re traveling?<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the most important step is to make sure the house fits your budget and lifestyle now, you also want it to grow with you into the future. Just like the plants and the dog.<br><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There&#8217;s no good reason to wait for a partner when you want to start investing in your future now, but there&#8217;s a lot you need to know about going it alone.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":129,"featured_media":10393,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[7231,7237],"tags":[958,1206,529,1101,1209],"yst_prominent_words":[6737,6706,3281,6729,6731,6791,6739,1237,6790,6789,6738,1245,1214,6734,6730,6736,6202,6735,3112,6733],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/10391"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/129"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=10391"}],"version-history":[{"count":7,"href":"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/10391\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":12038,"href":"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/10391\/revisions\/12038"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/10393"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=10391"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=10391"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=10391"},{"taxonomy":"yst_prominent_words","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/yst_prominent_words?post=10391"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
