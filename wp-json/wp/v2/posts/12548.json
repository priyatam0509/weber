In fact, <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/your-high-yield-cash-account-shouldnt-be-your-only-savings-vehicle\/\">sitting in cash often generates a negative return after adjusting for inflation<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We know there are lots of reasons why people hold onto too much cash, but some of them are more rational than others. It\u2019s smart to hold cash for a short-term goal like an upcoming home purchase because you don\u2019t want to take market risk on your big down payment, and it\u2019s a good idea to <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/build-emergency-fund\/\">have a rainy-day fund<\/a>. But as we will explain, it\u2019s not a good idea to hold cash because you\u2019ve heard the market might be at an all time high.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>\u201cBuy low, sell high\u201d is easier said than done<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ve probably heard the common investing advice to \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/buying-dip\/\">buy low,<\/a> sell high,\u201d meaning you should purchase stocks when the price is down (and they\u2019re \u201con sale\u201d), then sell them when they are at peak price. That\u2019s good advice that will generate a very high return if you can consistently determine the right time to buy and sell. The unfortunate reality is that it\u2019s almost <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/top-investor-mistake-time-market\/\">impossible to do consistently<\/a>. Less than 10% of professional investors like mutual fund and hedge fund managers outperform the market after five years. But that doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t invest in the stock market. It just means you should buy index funds rather than trying to outperform the market by picking stocks. As we have pointed out in the past, <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/investing-when-many-pundits-predict-a-recession\/\">investing successfully has nothing to do with timing the market<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>It doesn\u2019t matter that the market is at an \u201call-time high\u201d<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you don\u2019t consider yourself a market timer, your friends and the media might be telling you that the market is at an all-time high right now. Therefore it must be a terrible time to invest, right? Wrong!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a trap you don\u2019t want to fall into. If you\u2019re tempted to defer investing for this reason, here\u2019s what you should do: <\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Look at the last time the market was at an all-time high. On average, this has happened roughly<strong> 1 in every 14 market days<\/strong> since 1950. If you had taken the advice to not invest the last time the market was at an all-time high, it\u2019s likely you would have missed the <em>current <\/em>all-time high. Of course there are bull and bear markets (extended periods of very positive and very negative trends), but the beginning and end of these trends are impossible to predict.<\/li><li>Think longer-term. Since 1950, the S&amp;P 500 closed the year higher than it closed the previous year 72% of the time (you can see this upward trend in the chart below). If you look at five-year time periods instead, that number is close to 80%.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>To demonstrate the magnitude of what you might lose by not investing when the market is at an all-time high, let\u2019s look at an example. Let\u2019s assume you were considering investing $10,000 in the S&amp;P 500 on January 26, 2018 but felt too nervous to do so because the market was at all all-time high. As you can see from the chart below, the market hit many more all-time highs in the next 2 years \u2014 47, to be exact. In this situation, your reluctance to invest would have cost you $1,602 before taxes over that period of time. Trying to time the market can prove very expensive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"917\" height=\"530\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/SP-500-graph-02-917x530.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-12549\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/SP-500-graph-02-917x530.png 917w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/SP-500-graph-02-640x370.png 640w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/SP-500-graph-02-768x444.png 768w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/SP-500-graph-02-1536x888.png 1536w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/SP-500-graph-02-2048x1183.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 917px) 100vw, 917px\" \/><figcaption>Source: Yahoo Finance<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>The best strategy is buy &amp; hold a diversified portfolio<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of obsessing over daily fluctuations in the S&amp;P 500, you should buy a diversified portfolio. The beauty of buying a diversified portfolio that holds relatively non-correlated asset classes is that it should always increase in value over the long term, because when some asset classes are down, others will be up.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re worried about the regret you might feel if you invest now (at a \u201cmarket high\u201d) and the market plunges in the short term, we recommend checking out our <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/dollar-cost-averaging-behavioral-view\/\">blog post on dollar-cost averaging<\/a>. Setting up a small recurring deposit to spread your investment out over time might help ease that fear.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The U.S. stock market may be at or near an all-time high, but that shouldn\u2019t affect your decision to invest at all. The S&amp;P 500 has hit <em>many<\/em> all-time highs before, and there\u2019s every reason to believe it will continue to do so. The advice to \u201cbuy low and sell high\u201d is virtually impossible to follow (even for professional investors!) and you shouldn\u2019t bother trying. You\u2019re far more likely to come out ahead if you put your money into a diversified portfolio and leave it there.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Many of our clients hold too much cash even though it\u2019s no secret that investing that money is likely to earn a much better return over the long term.
