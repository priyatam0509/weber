We were pleased to see that the majority of our clients feel on track to meet their goals and are stashing money in emergency funds and retirement accounts.<\/p>\n<p>But while surveys capture attitudes and beliefs, it\u2019s data that completes the story. We decided to crunch the numbers and analyze our millennial clients\u2019 total savings rates to better understand their savings behavior. (Read the full description of our methodology <a href=\"#methodology\">here<\/a>.)<\/p>\n<p>The numbers paint a really encouraging picture about our younger clients: they know how to save. Read on for more insights.<\/p>\n<h2>Our youngest clients are off to a great start<\/h2>\n<p>Thanks to increased life expectancies, reduced Social Security benefits, and a lack of pensions, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nirsonline.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/02\/Millennials-Report-1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">National Institute on Retirement Security (NIRS) reports<\/a> some bleak millennial savings trends: this generation may need to save 15% to 22% of their annual salaries to make it through retirement. That\u2019s double the 10% savings rate recommended for previous generations \u2014 and the report showed that only 5% of millennials across America are meeting it.<\/p>\n<p>The NIRS report also found that 66.2% of millennials have nothing saved for retirement. Of the people with retirement accounts, the vast majority (82.4%) save less than 6% of their annual salary.<\/p>\n<p>The good news is that Wealthfront clients are bucking those millennial savings trends. We found our youngest clients actually save at the highest rate. Our data shows that, on average, our 20 to 25-year-old clients are saving 18% of their pre-tax annual salary \u2014 that&#8217;s around 3x the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bea.gov\/data\/income-saving\/personal-saving-rate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">national savings rate<\/a>. (Note: While our younger clients are saving at higher rates than other age groups, they save <em>less<\/em> <em>money<\/em> overall.)<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-9421\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/age-group-blog-compressor-727x530.png\" alt=\"Percentage of Pre-tax Annual Income Saved by Age Group\" width=\"727\" height=\"530\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/age-group-blog-compressor-727x530.png 727w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/age-group-blog-compressor-640x467.png 640w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/age-group-blog-compressor-768x560.png 768w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/age-group-blog-compressor-330x240.png 330w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/age-group-blog-compressor.png 1174w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 727px) 100vw, 727px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt is rewarding to see data demonstrate that our clients don&#8217;t fit the tired narrative that millennials don&#8217;t save and plan for the future,\u201d says Daniel McAuley, our Principal Data Scientist. \u201cWe are excited to see what we learn next about ways to positively affect client financial behavior through software and education.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Our clients\u2019 annual savings rates are very encouraging \u2014 and when it comes to total amount saved to date, the data is also promising. For example, our average 20 to 25-year-old client has accumulated the equivalent of 40% of their annual pre-tax salary across different types of accounts (including retirement accounts). That number rises to 50% for the 25 to 30 bracket, and 86% for those aged 30 to 35.<\/p>\n<p>Wealthfront client Levi Francis, a 25-year-old engineer living in Cleveland, OH, is just one example of a younger millennial motivated to save. He has his eye on achieving financial independence and wants to retire by age 55. &#8220;When I save, I&#8217;m paying my future self,&#8221; says Levi. &#8220;I want to have many active years without worrying about generating income. That reality is very liberating.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2>The more you earn, the more you save? Not exactly\u2026<\/h2>\n<p>One of the perennial rules of personal finance is to avoid \u201clifestyle inflation\u201d: increasing your spending at the same rate as your earning. In other words, you shouldn\u2019t trade your Camry for a Lexus just because you got a raise. Instead, you should increase your savings rate.<\/p>\n<p>Our clients adhere to that rule&#8230; to an extent. We found that savings rates increased alongside salaries until clients started making more than $135,000 per year. After that, savings rates flattened out, and then slightly decreased.<\/p>\n<p>This means that clients making between $120,000 and $135,000 per year saved at slightly higher rates than any other group \u2014 including those who make more than $200,000 per year.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-9416\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/Annual-Income-Savings-Rate-compressor-1451x530.png\" alt=\"Annual income of clients with the highest savings rate\" width=\"1451\" height=\"530\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/Annual-Income-Savings-Rate-compressor-1451x530.png 1451w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/Annual-Income-Savings-Rate-compressor-640x234.png 640w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/Annual-Income-Savings-Rate-compressor-768x280.png 768w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/Annual-Income-Savings-Rate-compressor.png 1714w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1451px) 100vw, 1451px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhile you should celebrate a hard-earned promotion or salary increase, a raise shouldn\u2019t mean a dramatic lifestyle change,\u201d says Ashley Fieglein Johnson, our Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer. \u201cFinancially, the smartest post-raise move is to funnel your extra money straight into debt payoff or investments \u2014 and not change your spending habits.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Wealthfront client Parth Patel, a 24-year-old working in financial services in Richmond, VA, follows that advice. As he&#8217;s gotten promotions and raises at work, he tries to scale his savings at a similar rate. &#8220;It&#8217;s easy to avoid lifestyle creep if your extra income goes straight to savings,&#8221; Parth says.<\/p>\n<h2>Single and ready to save<\/h2>\n<p>Judging from the way young, single millennials are often portrayed in the media, you would assume they waste their money on avocado toast and designer coffee. Once again, Wealthfront clients emphatically dispel those myths. We found that, on average, our single clients save at higher rates than our married clients.<\/p>\n<p>Our bachelors and bachelorettes save an average of 17% of their pre-tax annual salary, a couple of percentage points higher than our married clients (15%). Our \u201chigh saver\u201d clients \u2014 those squirreling away more than 20% of their salaries each year \u2014 are also more likely to be single.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-9417\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/Married-v-Single-savings-rate-compressor-987x530.png\" alt=\"Average savings rate of married vs single clients\" width=\"987\" height=\"530\" srcset=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/Married-v-Single-savings-rate-compressor-987x530.png 987w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/Married-v-Single-savings-rate-compressor-640x344.png 640w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/Married-v-Single-savings-rate-compressor-768x412.png 768w, https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/Married-v-Single-savings-rate-compressor.png 1401w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 987px) 100vw, 987px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>While we don\u2019t have hard evidence as to why this is happening, our hunch is that the expenses that come with settling down \u2014 namely, paying for a wedding, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/home-planning\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">buying a home<\/a>, and having a child \u2014 tend to drive up expenses for a new couple. And that means their savings rate can flatten, and that their savings accounts might even take a dip.<\/p>\n<h2>The magic of time<\/h2>\n<p>One of the key benefits for our younger clients with good savings hygiene? Time. Clients who start saving early in their adult lives will benefit from the <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/compound-interest\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">incredible power of compounding<\/a>. And the longer they use a solution like Wealthfront, the better. In fact, we found that engaging with our financial advice engine, Path, correlates to an almost <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/2018-wealthfront-savings-report\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">28% increase<\/a> in a client\u2019s savings rate.<\/p>\n<p>Learn more about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/planning\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">starting your own savings journey here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><a name=\"methodology\"><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Methodology<\/h3>\n<p>Our research team looked at Wealthfront Advisers LLC (\u201cWealthfront Adviser\u201d) client data from 8\/1\/2017-10\/10\/2018.
