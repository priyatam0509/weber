Read more about it <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/the-wealthfront-cash-account-apy-is-decreasing-to-0-10-percent\/\">here<\/a>\n.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, the annual percentage yield (APY) on the Wealthfront Cash Account is decreasing from 2.32% to 2.07%. This change comes as a result of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2019\/09\/18\/business\/economy\/fed-interest-rate-cut.html\">Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to lower the target federal funds rate by 0.25% to 2.00%<\/a>. While a lower APY isn\u2019t exactly news we\u2019re happy about, this new rate is still <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/how-the-high-interest-rate-on-wealthfront-cash-accounts-does-what-banks-refuse-to-do\/\">20 times higher than it would in a traditional bank savings account<\/a>, according to Bankrate.com. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the clearest terms, here\u2019s what a lower APY on your Wealthfront Cash Account means for your money: a 0.25% rate decrease means that every $1,000 in your account will now earn $2.50 less in annual interest.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So why is the APY on your cash account lower after the Federal Reserve cut rates? As you know, <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/how-the-fed-funds-rate-impacts-the-wealthfront-cash-account\/\">the fed funds rate is the rate at which banks lend each other funds<\/a> overnight, meaning a rate decrease affects nearly every financial institution and thus consumers directly. The impact isn\u2019t all bad: when the rate goes down, so do mortgage rates. But the rates on high-yield savings accounts and Certificates of Deposit (CDs) go down, too \u2014 and so does the rate on the Wealthfront Cash Account.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, there\u2019s nothing we can do to make the Wealthfront Cash Account immune from cuts to the fed funds rate \u2014 when the Fed lowers rates, we have to follow suit. But here\u2019s what we <em>can<\/em> do: we\u2019ll talk to you when things change. We promise to continue keeping you as informed as possible about what\u2019s happening with your money. You already know we believe your money should be making money for <em>you <\/em>and not your bank, but beyond that, we think you deserve to genuinely understand what\u2019s going on with your money. For example, before the Fed cut rates earlier this year, we told you that <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/how-the-fed-funds-rate-impacts-the-wealthfront-cash-account\/\">if they did, the APY on your Wealthfront Cash Account would go down too<\/a>. Your ability to grow your money is firmly at the center of everything we do, so we have no reason to keep you in the dark. It\u2019s easy for us to be transparent about what we\u2019re doing and why.
