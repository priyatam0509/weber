Bill Gurley, for instance, suggests that companies with revenues of $40 &#8211; $100 million are large enough to launch an IPO. Here\u2019s just one example: Jive Software, whose CEO is speaking at the conference, had $77 million of revenue in 2011, the year of its IPO.In addition, Congress is working on legislation to make it easier for small companies to go public, and as of this writing the JOBS Act was expected to be signed by President Obama in the next few days. (Here\u2019s a good <a href=\"http:\/\/finance.fortune.cnn.com\/2012\/03\/22\/jobs-act-the-good-the-bad-the-irrelevant\/\">post<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/TENOR\/ipo-task-force\">slideshare<\/a> on the Act.) Congress moved unusually quickly to pass the legislation for the same reason that smart companies should aim for IPOs: growth. The private-sector <a href=\"http:\/\/news.yahoo.com\/ipo-task-force-issues-recommendations-improve-capital-markets-100249406.html\">IPO Task Force<\/a>, which issued recommendations to Congress, found that more than 90% of a company\u2019s growth occurred after the IPO.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>It\u2019s harder than ever to have a technology IPO?<\/strong> <em>False<\/em>. In 2010 and 2011, there were 73 technology IPOs, with an average offer amount of $196 million. While that doesn\u2019t approach the level of the 1990s\u2019 IPO boom, this year is expected to be a banner year for tech IPOs, led by, of course, Facebook. Here is a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/huge-tech-ipos-2011\">slideshow<\/a> that lists 11 tech IPOs slated for 2012. The market goes up and down, of course, but this week alone was a great week for IPO stocks. LinkedIn (<a href=\"http:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/q?s=LNKD\">LNKD<\/a>) and Jive Software (<a href=\"http:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/q?s=JIVE\">JIVE<\/a>) were both trading at more than twice their IPO prices. Yelp (<a href=\"http:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/q?s=YELP&amp;ql=1\">YELP<\/a>) hit a post-IPO high, and Zynga\u2019s (<a href=\"http:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/q?s=ZNGA\">ZNGA<\/a>) stock price was up 22% since its IPO.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Private markets are removing the need for IPOs.<\/strong> <em>Not really.<\/em> Companies are waiting longer to go public, and that change has been aided by the rise of private markets like SecondMarket. But nothing can replace the role of the public stock market. Private markets are exclusive and open only to high-net-worth individuals, in contrast to the public equities market. The public markets not only allow companies to raise more capital when they need it, they give companies a boost of credibility. \u201cYou\u2019re taken more seriously,\u201d Ben Horowtiz told Wealthfront interviewers. \u201cPeople say, \u2018We know what your financials are like.\u2019\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Do these ideas seem familiar?
