We hated doing this, and in the weeks following the cut, we searched tirelessly for ways to pay you more. We succeeded \u2013 we found a bank that was willing to pay a higher interest rate on deposits for one year because the additional deposits allowed them to make more <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sba.gov\/funding-programs\/loans\/covid-19-relief-options\/paycheck-protection-program\">Paycheck Protection Program<\/a> loans. In turn, we <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wealthfront-cash-account-035-apy\/\">raised our APY to pass along that interest to you<\/a>. It was a win-win.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, that deal has now run out and banks are no longer willing to pay much for deposits. As a result, we are lowering the APY on our Cash Account from 0.35% APY to 0.10%. We know this is disappointing news. We\u2019ll keep working hard to find ways to pay you more interest, just as we\u2019ve done in the past.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Low interest rates and a glut of deposits&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The APY on the Cash Account is in large part determined by the rate we receive from our partner banks. The rate banks pay depends on two factors: the effective federal funds rate (EFFR) and how eager they are to pay for deposits (which translates to a premium fixed to the EFFR). Typically, banks are willing to pay more for deposits in periods of economic expansion as they are, for example, able to make more from lending those deposits than they pay to acquire them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/EFFR\">EFFR fell sharply in 2020<\/a> and has remained very low. And during the past year, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2020\/06\/21\/banks-have-grown-by-2-trillion-in-deposits-since-coronavirus-first-hit.html\">bank deposits climbed to record levels<\/a> \u2013 meaning banks are awash in cash and aren\u2019t willing to pay much for deposits. Combined, these developments mean that our partner banks are paying us very little right now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>People, not institutions&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Even with a lower rate, the Cash Account helps you simplify your finances and grow your wealth faster. With the Cash Account, you can access all the checking features you need, get paid up to two days early with direct deposit, automate your savings strategy with automatic transfers that are sensitive to your spending, and <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/invest-within-minutes-transfer-cash-to-investment-account\/\">invest your money within minutes <\/a>when you transfer funds to a Wealthfront Investment Account.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are deeply committed to our mission to build a <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wealthfronts-new-mission\/\">financial system that benefits people, not institutions<\/a>. That mission is at the heart of everything we do, and your financial wellbeing is central to every decision we make as a company. We can\u2019t pay you more interest right now, but we remain extremely focused on providing value to you in other ways. Tomorrow, we\u2019ll be rolling out powerful new features to help you streamline and customize the way you manage your finances. We look forward to sharing them with you.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A year ago, as a result of the economic turmoil accompanying the pandemic, the Federal Open Market Committee decreased the federal funds rate dramatically and we were forced to cut the APY on the Wealthfront Cash Account to 0.26%.
