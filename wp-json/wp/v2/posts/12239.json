The most popular ones are 401(k)s, traditional IRAs, and Roth IRAs. They come with different tax advantages to encourage you to put money away for later.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, the basics: a 401(k) is an employer-sponsored plan with high contribution limits and few investment options. You get a tax deduction when you contribute to a 401(k). Individual retirement accounts, or IRAs, are accounts that you open for yourself with lower contribution limits and more flexibility around investment options. In general (depending on your income and whether you are covered by an employer-sponsored plan) you get a tax deduction in the year that you contribute to a traditional IRA and then pay taxes on withdrawals. With a Roth IRA, you don\u2019t get a tax deduction when you contribute, but your qualified withdrawals are tax-free.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roth IRAs are a powerful way to take advantage of years and years of tax-free growth. But if you earn more than $137,000 as an individual or $203,000 as a married couple filing jointly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/retirement-plans\/roth-iras\">in 2019<\/a>, you can\u2019t contribute directly to a Roth IRA. That\u2019s where Roth conversions come in.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Roth conversion is when you move funds from a traditional IRA or SEP IRA to a Roth IRA. You might owe taxes in the year of the conversion (depending on whether you have any pre-tax funds in an IRA), but then your funds can grow and your qualified withdrawals will be tax-free. There are two common instances when someone would likely benefit from a Roth conversion:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>One-off conversion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s say you know you\u2019re in an exceptionally low-earning year. Maybe you\u2019re going to graduate school or you\u2019re taking time off to see the world. You have an existing traditional IRA with some pre-tax funds in it (either because you rolled over a 401(k) from a previous employer or you contributed to one directly), and since you\u2019re in a lower-than-usual tax bracket, this is a great time to pay taxes on the conversion and then benefit from tax-free growth and withdrawals.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s look at an example. Say you\u2019re taking some time off and you know you\u2019ll be earning a lot less this year than you normally do. As a result, let\u2019s assume your ordinary income tax rate will be 20% this year instead of the 40% it would be in a typical year. You have $10,000 in a traditional IRA, and you\u2019re wondering if you should do a Roth conversion. If you were to leave the money in a traditional IRA for 30 years, assuming a 6% compounded return, it would be worth $34,460.95 after paying a 40% tax upon withdrawal. However if you converted the account to a Roth IRA, you\u2019d pay $2,000 in taxes now (20% current income tax rate multiplied by the value of the account), but the value of the remaining $8,000 compounded at 6% annually over the next 30 years would be worth $45,947.93 after tax because you wouldn\u2019t owe any additional taxes upon withdrawal. Converting your traditional IRA in a low-earning year has the potential to give your retirement savings a huge boost.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Backdoor Roth<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s say you want to save some additional money for the long term, but you earn too much to contribute directly to a Roth IRA and\/or you are covered by your employer\u2019s 401(k) plan (you may not be able to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/retirement-plans\/plan-participant-employee\/2020-ira-contribution-and-deduction-limits-effect-of-modified-agi-on-deductible-contributions-if-you-are-covered-by-a-retirement-plan-at-work\">deduct contributions to a traditional IRA<\/a> if you are covered by an employer\u2019s 401(k) plan). Assuming you don\u2019t have any pre-tax money in a traditional IRA and don\u2019t anticipate needing the funds within five years, you\u2019re likely to benefit from a Roth conversion.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, let us explain with an example. If you fit the description above, you can either invest by opening a taxable investment account or making a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. If you invest $6,000 in a taxable investment account at a 6% compounded return over 30 years, ignoring the taxes you\u2019d have to pay on dividends and the gains associated with account rebalancing, your account would be worth $34,460.95 at retirement, but you\u2019d still owe capital gains taxes when you sell to withdraw. If your capital gains tax rate in retirement were 15% then that account would only be worth $30,191.81 after taxes. However if you contributed $6,000 to a traditional IRA account instead and converted to a Roth IRA, your account would be worth $34,460.95 at withdrawal because you would owe no taxes on the sales. That\u2019s the power of Roth conversions. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Roth conversions made simple<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wealthfront-now-offers-easy-roth-conversions\/\">Wealthfront now offers automated Roth conversions<\/a>, which have been a top request from our clients since our founding.
