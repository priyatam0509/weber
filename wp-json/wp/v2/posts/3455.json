I don\u2019t want to comment on whether this is justified. It\u2019s just the market rate firms pay to attract people to the job, which in most cases means applying Modern Portfolio Theory to a client\u2019s assets.<\/p>\n<p>If you assume an average Private Wealth Manager can actively support 50 client portfolios, and she charges an annual fee of 1% of assets under management, then she needs to attract at least $1 million per client just so the company breaks even on her compensation ($500k\/50 *1%).\u00a0 Add in support staff and corporate overhead, and the breakeven grows to at least $1.5 million per account. Most businesses need to earn a 50% gross margin to take selling and market costs into account; Private Wealth Managers are no different. That means they need at least $3 million to achieve their business model.<\/p>\n<div class=\"pullquote-left\">\n<p class=\"pullquote\">The top Private Wealth Managers make about $900,000 annually.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>Now you can understand how the better-paid Private Wealth Managers, like the ones you might find at Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase, might require $10 million account minimums.<\/p>\n<p>In his popular WSJ contributed column, \u201c<a title=\"Marc Andreessen Wall Street Journal article\" href=\"http:\/\/online.wsj.com\/article\/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460.html\" target=\"_blank\">Why Software Is Eating The World<\/a>,\u201d Marc Andreessen argues that every industry will be disrupted by software. The disruption happens when software eliminates an expensive middleman with no discernable loss of quality. Financial Services, Health Care and Education are some of the last remaining industries to be disrupted. I addressed the reasons why in a <a title=\"PandoDaily on software eating the world\" href=\"http:\/\/pandodaily.com\/2012\/04\/18\/why-hasnt-software-eaten-healthcare-finance-and-education-yet\/\" target=\"_blank\">column<\/a> I wrote for PandoDaily.<\/p>\n<p align=\"left\">By eliminating a middleman \u2013 the highly paid Private Wealth Manager \u2013\u00a0Wealthfront can offer a comparable Modern Portfolio Theory-based investment service, with only a $5,000 account minimum. \u00a0High account minimums have nothing to do with the quality of the service, and everything to do with the underlying business model.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>At a recent investing seminar at LinkedIn, a young engineer asked a question I\u2019ve heard repeatedly over the past year: Why do Private Wealth Managers have such high account minimums?
