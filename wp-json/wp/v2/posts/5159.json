Otherwise let our automated software do its work.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why You Shouldn\u2019t Look: Understanding Loss Aversion<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Constantly checking in on your portfolio is bad for both your financial and mental health.<\/p>\n<p>There are a variety of reasons for this, but the most compelling involves the basic investor psychology of loss aversion.<\/p>\n<p>First documented by Daniel Kahneman (who guest contributed <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/illusion-stock-picking-skill\/\">The Illusion of Stock-Picking Skill<\/a> to our blog) and Amos Tversky in 1984, loss aversion refers to the fact that people dislike losing money more than they like making it. The New York Times interviewed Professor Kahneman about loss aversion in 2013:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cIn my classes, I say: \u2018I\u2019m going to toss a coin, and if it\u2019s tails, you lose $10. How much would you have to gain on winning in order for this gamble to be acceptable to you?\u2019<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPeople want more than $20 before it is acceptable. And now I\u2019ve been doing the same thing with executives or very rich people, asking about tossing a coin and losing $10,000 if it\u2019s tails. And they want $20,000 before they\u2019ll take the gamble.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In other words, we\u2019re willing to leave a lot of money on the table to avoid the possibility of losing.<\/p>\n<p>Think about it. Would you take a bet on a coin flip that would pay out $10.10 but cost you $10.00 if you lose? In a rational world, you should. But the sting of a loss weighs heavily on our minds, so most people avoid the bet.<\/p>\n<p>The result is one of the most consistent in behavioral finance, and has been demonstrated over and over and over again.<\/p>\n<p>What does this have to do with checking your portfolio? Well, the stock market is a volatile beast. Over long periods of time, it tends to go up. But on any given day, it\u2019s more or less a toss-up.<\/p>\n<p>If you check your portfolio every day, there\u2019s a 50% chance that it will be up and you\u2019ll feel <em>a<\/em> <em>little<\/em> happy; but there\u2019s also a 50% chance that it will be down and you\u2019ll feel <em>very<\/em> bad. And it\u2019s actually worse than that.<\/p>\n<p>The average Wealthfront portfolio has seven or eight core asset classes. On any given day &#8212; even when the markets are up &#8212; one or more of those asset classes may trade down. Behavioral finance suggests that these \u201closers\u201d will bother you more than the winners will excite you.<\/p>\n<p>A study in the Journal of Behavioral Finance showed that presenting asset level returns to investors decreases people\u2019s willingness to tolerate risk, because people are sensitive to losses at the individual asset class level.<\/p>\n<p>If you listen to this fear inside you, you might dial down your risk score in your Wealthfront portfolio, putting yourself into a more conservative portfolio than you would otherwise hold.<\/p>\n<p>The more time you spend looking at and worrying about your portfolio, the more likely you are to make changes to your plan, whether that\u2019s withdrawing money or adjusting your risk tolerance \u2013 and over the long term that will lead to lower returns!<\/p>\n<p>SigFig did a study of its portfolio tracking software users and found that its average user checked her portfolio 8 times a month. Investors who checked their portfolios daily earned, on average, <em>0.2% less per year<\/em> than the average investor; those that checked their portfolios twice a day earned, on average, <em>0.4% less per year<\/em>, largely because they traded too often.<\/p>\n<p>Checking your portfolio can be hazardous to your financial health!<\/p>\n<p><strong>If You Shouldn\u2019t Look, Why Do We Show You?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If showing people their portfolio returns makes them sad and leads to bad behavior, why do we do it?<\/p>\n<p>Clients place an enormous amount of faith in us when they invest money with us, and they want to see how and where it is allocated. It\u2019s their right.<\/p>\n<p>We go to great lengths in our communication and our information design to portray things in their most appropriate light and to limit self-destructive behavior. For example, we only allow people to adjust their risk tolerance once per month. But in the end, it\u2019s your money, so we design the tools and apps that you demand.<\/p>\n<p>Still, that doesn\u2019t mean you should use them every day.<\/p>\n<hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\" \/>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 10px;line-height: 12px\"><strong>Disclosure<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 10px;line-height: 12px\">Nothing in this article should be construed as a solicitation or offer, or recommendation, to buy or sell any security.
