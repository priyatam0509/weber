The economic returns that follow from good career decisions in the technology industry \u2013 especially the decisions that maximize your equity &#8212; are much larger than the returns that follow from good investment decisions, by a measure of hundreds of thousands of dollars.<\/p>\n<p>For more career advice, we&#8217;ve built out an entire section of our <a title=\"Tech Career Advice\" href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/category\/tech-startup-compensation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Knowledge Center<\/a> to help you plan.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Adopt a data-driven approach to investing<\/h2>\n<p>This fundamental shift will make an enormous difference in your net worth over your lifetime. Letting go of the instincts and biases that damage investment returns is not easy. (In our recent post on RSUs, we talked about the way cognitive dissonance and risk aversion can keep you from a smart decision about <a title=\"Why You Should Treat Vested RSUs As A Cash Bonus\" href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/manage-vested-rsus\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">how much of your RSUs to sell<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>Research shows that the best way to maximize your investment returns is to use a diversified, risk-adjusted portfolio and rebalance consistently. Like the top university endowments, we use six different asset classes; we are adding more in the new year. You can see your recommended asset allocation by answering 10 questions in our <a title=\"Wealthfront Risk Assessment\" href=\"https:\/\/www.wealthfront.com\/questions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">risk assessment tool<\/a>. The information is free through our tool \u2013 you don\u2019t have to be a client. We won\u2019t even ask for your email.<\/p>\n<p>Our risk assessment questionnaire is unique because it takes into account <a title=\"Why Risk Tolerance Matters in Investing\" href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/what-is-risk-tolerance\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">normal human biases<\/a> that affect how accurately people can assess their own risk tolerance.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Develop a plan to sell your stock<\/h2>\n<p>People who work in Silicon Valley often amass valuable options or stock. Most tech company stocks crash and burn, and a few, which drive the returns for the entire industry, are huge winners. That means your decision about when and how much to sell can make an enormous difference in your portfolio.<\/p>\n<p>Consider our other research into how to make decisions about <a title=\"When Should You Sell Your Stock Post-IPO?\" href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/should-i-sell-my-stock\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">your company\u2019s stock<\/a>. We found that among the tech companies that went public between 2002 and 2008, the stocks most likely to do well had consistent or accelerating revenue growth and expanding margins. We also found that public companies that missed at least one of their first two earnings reports were more likely to have stocks that declined in the <a title=\"Real Data-Based Guidance On Selling Stock Post-IPO\" href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/selling-stock-post-ipo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">first three months after an IPO<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve given you tools and information to help you fulfill these three New Year\u2019s Resolutions.
