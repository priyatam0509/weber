What most people don\u2019t realize is the same\u00a080\/20 ratio holds true for public tech investing. The imbalance is even more\u00a0profound for tech IPO investing.<\/p>\n<p>We found that for companies that went public between 2002 and 2008, 21%\u00a0of the companies generated 96% of the gains. Just like in venture capital, a\u00a0majority of the companies that went public during this period (56%) turned\u00a0out to be losing investments.<\/p>\n<p>Venture capitalists and professional public company tech investors train for\u00a0years and collaborate with other talented partners to identify the 20% of the\u00a0companies that generated 80% of the upside. Imagine how difficult it must\u00a0be for tech employees to decide if they should hold on to their options or sell\u00a0them post IPO.<\/p>\n<p>As part of our mission to democratize access to sophisticated investment\u00a0advice, we drilled down into the tech IPO data to help our clients, many of whom are employees of tech companies, develop a\u00a0thoughtful plan as to when they should sell. Based on advice from some\u00a0of the best tech investors we know, we divided the 115 tech companies\u00a0that went public between 2002 and 2008 into six buckets based on revenue\u00a0growth and margin expansion.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/should-i-sell-my-stock\/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" title=\"When should you sell your tech IPO employee stock?\" src=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/04\/115IPOs.png\" alt=\"When should you sell your tech IPO employee stock?\" width=\"539\" height=\"390\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><em>(for <strong>Definitions<\/strong>, see bottom of the post)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Our research found the 24 companies (21% of the IPOs) that had rapidly\u00a0expanding revenues and an expanding profit margin had median annual\u00a0returns of 5.7% a year for their first three years as public companies. That&#8217;s\u00a08% better per year than the annual return of the S&amp;P 500 over the same\u00a0three-year periods. An additional 14, which had slower-growing revenue\u00a0and expanding margins, generated a positive return (a median of 4.2% a year\u00a0for three years). The median outcome of the remaining 77 companies was -10.5%.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, there\u2019s no way to predict before the fact whether a company\u2019s\u00a0revenues and profit margin will expand. There is no crystal ball. But we\u00a0can draw a reasonable conclusion: If the company grows rapidly and has\u00a0a scalable business model, its revenues and margins are likely to expand.\u00a0Therefore, if you are lucky enough to be an employee of a company that\u2019s one of those few, you should feel comfortable holding on to some of your employee stock.\u00a0(For a fuller discussion of the rest of the reasoning that should go into your\u00a0decision, see our post <a title=\"How to sell a concentrated stock positions\" href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/how-to-sell-concentrated-stock-position\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Over What Time Period Should I Sell My LinkedIn\u00a0Shares?<\/em><\/a>)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Rapidly Growing Revenues<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>To grow at a rapid rate, your company needs to address a very big market\u00a0(one that is a large multiple of your current revenues) and have a durable\u00a0plan of attack. A saturated market is the biggest reason for revenue growth\u00a0deceleration.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to note that fast-growing revenue early in a company\u2019s life is\u00a0not necessarily a sign that the company\u2019s revenue growth will continue.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Scalable Model<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Expanding margins are a sign that a business model is scalable and therefore\u00a0attractive to public investors. Most public tech stock investors look for\u00a0momentum, and there\u2019s no greater sign of momentum than earnings\u00a0growing faster than revenues. The best way to tell if your business model is\u00a0scalable is to determine whether you can add customers faster than you add\u00a0employees.<\/p>\n<p>Wealthfront published a post-IPO stock sale &#8220;calculator&#8221; to\u00a0help our clients determine when they should sell their stock. This simulator, which has now been retired, allows you to test a variety of stock sales strategies on 10 public tech companies. These 10 companies were chosen because they represent the\u00a0five classic trading patterns (big winners, big losers, oscillating, U-shaped\u00a0and upside down U-shaped) that we were able to discern from the 1,200\u00a0companies that went public over the previous 10 years. At the time we\u00a0published the simulator, we could not provide guidance as to which of the\u00a0trading patterns your company was likely to end up fitting.\u00a0\u00a0Armed with our\u00a0latest research, we think you can now make a more informed guess.<\/p>\n<p>Based on our research, if you think you work for a company that is likely to\u00a0continue to grow rapidly and expand its margins, you may want to hold on to\u00a0your employee stock or develop a sales strategy that is most similar to our Strategy B\u00a0(sell 10% of what remains every quarter).<\/p>\n<p>If you truly believe you work for one of the big winners, the idea of holding\u00a0on to all of your employee stock might seem seductive. But even the likely winners can\u00a0fall prey to a market decline just when you need the money, or to some other\u00a0unforeseen event.\u00a0That\u2019s why we feel confident saying you are more likely to sleep well at\u00a0night if you sell a little bit every quarter, but do so in a way that captures\u00a0much of the upside. To see what we mean, try Strategy B on Google and Salesforce.<\/p>\n<p>If you think your company is in the slow revenue growth and expanding\u00a0margin bucket, you\u2019re probably best served with Strategy A or C. Try\u00a0this on Seagate to see what we mean.<\/p>\n<p>If you think your company is in one of the other four buckets, you\u00a0probably want to sell as soon as possible&#8230;other than right after the lockup\u00a0release (please see our post <em><a title=\"Upfront Blog on selling stock post-IPO lockup\" href=\"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/selling-stock-post-ipo-lockup\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The One Day to Avoid\u00a0Selling Your Company Stock<\/a><\/em> for more advice on this\u00a0topic).<\/p>\n<p>We recognize that if you\u2019re human, you want your company to succeed\u00a0and might be inclined to hold on to the stock as a vote of confidence in its\u00a0future \u2013 or as the result of simple inertia. But it pays to apply some ruthless\u00a0analysis to your decisions about how rapidly to sell your employee stock.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Definitions<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Strong revenue growth<\/strong>: Quarterly sequential revenue growth &gt;= 5% or\u00a0growth in quarterly revenue growth &gt;0%<\/li>\n<li><strong>Slow revenue growth<\/strong>: Quarterly revenue growth between 0% and 5%,\u00a0and growth in quarterly revenue growth &lt;=0%<\/li>\n<li><strong>No revenue growth<\/strong>:\u00a0Quarterly revenue growth where growth &lt;=0%<\/li>\n<li><strong>Expanding margin<\/strong>: Quarterly margin growth where growth &gt;= 0%<\/li>\n<li><strong>Margin not expanding<\/strong>: Quarterly margin growth where growth &lt; 0%<\/li>\n<li><strong>Margin<\/strong>: Net income divided by revenue.\u00a0<em>Note:<\/em>\u00a0<em>The return numbers are annualized while the growth rate for revenue &amp;\u00a0margin are quarterly numbers.
