{"id":95,"name":"Steve Blank","url":"","description":"Steve Blank had already been having an exciting career prior to his 1978 arrival in Silicon Valley (see his personal blog, link above, for more on that). He then spent the next 21 years working at eight different high technology companies before he turned to writing and lecturing. Among his mix of companies were semi-conductor firms Zlog and MIPS Computers, as well as the web service E.piphany. Perhaps his best-known book, \u201cFour Steps to the Epiphany\u201d, is the groundbreaking work credited with having launched the Lean Startup movement. His latest book is \"The Startup Owners Manual\", with co-author Bob Dorf.","link":"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/author\/steveblank\/","slug":"steveblank","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/95"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/blog.wealthfront.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users"}]}}
